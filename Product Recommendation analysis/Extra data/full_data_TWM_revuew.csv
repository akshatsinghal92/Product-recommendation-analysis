Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,"I thought I’d give this a try as a cheap mixing whiskey (whiskey and coke, etc.). I bought a 750ml bottle and gave it a shot. It tasted terrible, but what really got me was the hangover. Two mixed drinks and I’d wake up at night with a headache. After the third time, I put it all together and realized this low grade whiskey was the cause of my problems. It was so bad, I actually poured it down the drain.",Do Not Buy This!

Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,"Spirits Direct offers many great products at fair prices; however, this one wasn't for me.

Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,Nose is of burnt cardboard and wet wipes. Not a great whiskey for drinking straight or with ice. Only using the bottle for mixing with coke or ginger beer and will not be buying again. No clue why this was recommended or the reviews here recommend it…,Not Drinkable By Itself
Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,Less expensive than Jack Daniels. It’s a good Sourmash whiskey. I have not tried it straight but mix it with diet Coke.

Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,"This whiskey takes some getting used to, especially if you usually drinks Kentucky. It has quite a bit of maple overtone on the nose that carries to the palate, so the first few sips makes you feel like you are drinking something entirely different. But it settles down to a decent whiskey. Medium body, not very dense but pleasant. Not a sipping whiskey. I like it with a single small cube of ice. More than that and the flavor loses focus. Great for the price though.",A Good Whiskey That Takes Some Getting Used To

Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,,Taste Just Like Jack!
Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,"A sales person pointed me to this. It is a cheaper whiskey but had very little bite. I like wine as well as bourbon but my wine palette does not like harsh bourbon/whiskey/scotch. What I found amazing is after it was opened and I would sip a little closing the shop, as it sat, it picked up more flavor. Initially it was much less flavorful. It aged a bit like wine as it sat in the bottle.",Smooth And Gains Flavor As It Breathes

Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,"This is absolutely the smoothest sour mash ever. My only issue with Lone Hand is I have a tendency to drink too much due to the smoothness.

Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,"During COVID, I have made a little game for myself trying different bourbons and whiskeys on the ""blue-collar shelf"" under $20. Some have been pleasant surprises and actually tasted better than more expensive bourbons. This one was an exception. It smells great on the nose. There is not much flavor on the palate and the finish resembled turpentine. It was rather disappointing. This appears to be a product of one of the mega-companies with no known source. This is NOT a Tennessee whiskey and is a disgrace to using the term. There are much cheaper bourbons on the shelf that are much better including Very Old Barton or even Old Fitzgerald. I would not purchase again.",Much Better Whiskeys To Try In Same Price Range

Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,"I have bought several bottles of this whiskey, and every time thought how good it was. This time around was still good, but it has a cloudyness to the bottle and kind of reminds me of raw moonshine. So, my advise is, reminiscent of Jack but definitely inspect the bottle before you buy.","Good, Taste Familiar"

Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,been buying for a few months now,Mix Or Straight Works For Me
Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,"This whiskey's taste seemed watery, lacking depth or complexity, and generally very underwhelming to me; not sure if it's the bottle I got, a problem with the batch, or something else. What made it worse was it had a artificial 'maple syrup' flavor present that, while faint, was still enough to be distracting even when mixed. Coupled together, these factors made it a grueling and unpleasant slog through the rest of the bottle (and we still ended up abandoning about 1/10 of it at the bottom anyway). Though I got it on sale in-store ($25) and on recommendation from a store representative, I just can't get past the taste. I would much rather buy Ezra Brooks, which is $10 cheaper and whose flavor is twice as good.","Weird Flavor, Poor Value"

Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,I bought this on the suggestion of an employee. It has very similar taste to Jack Daniel's. For the price point here a 1.75 was like 20 bucks. And for a party and mixed drinks it was good. Its for sure on party lists from now on.,Good Price And Good Taste

Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,"Lonehand Whiskey is value priced. I am of the opinion that good whiskey should be sipped either neat or on the rocks. I use Lonehand for mixing with a cola or in Old Fashions. It seems to me that anytime you add sugar, there is no need to use more expensive bourbon. Lonehand fits the bill nicely for mixing - its inexpensive, has a decent flavor (although a little sweet for sipping), and it mixes well.",A Little Sweet
Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,"All totaled, the whiskey is good, no gripes and even agree with some off putting comments by some. One thing you will notice if you ""really"" look at the label you will notice that is has only been aged ""A minimum of 12 months"".

Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,I was a bit pleased to see that this one is a nice drink. Great aroma hints of caramel and vanilla with a tad bit of smoke. Filtered through sugar maple charcoal it comes off with just a wee bit of sweetness upfront. Let it linger on the tongue and you'll get the warmth and spice of cinnamon. Tickles the tongue and lips and has a nice even warmth finish. A smooth drink with not a lot of heat or bitterness. It's not up there in my top ten but is is a good drink that I would not refuse if offered. Some people like it and some hate it but that's what it's all about...differences in preference and tastes.,It'S A Good Drink But Not Stellar.

Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,"Possibly the worst whiskey I've ever tasted. Chemical smell, so strong I almost tossed it before tasting. Should have! Some sales man said it was like Jack Daniels,not on this planet. Maybe good to loosen rusted bolts. Threw the junk away ( yes I called the Haz-Mat crew). There are lots of good sipping whiskies out there, this is NOT one of them",Total Garbage
Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,"Pretty sad about this...not that it is bad per se, but it has much of the taste of a Tequila. Which I guess is nice, but not even close to what I am looking for in a whiskey. I bought it...I'll drink it, but I'll never buy it again and I am kinda sad at the taste descriptions of it.",Nooope.

Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,"Has a flavor profile similar to Jack Daniels, a bit more on the vanilla side. This is great with a little splash of Vernor's Ginger Ale. The most appealing thing is its way more than just palatable and way more affordable than some bourbons with similar flavors.",Better Than Good Enough
Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,"I normally drink bourbons but this was a staff pick and one of the staff was telling me about how it’s better than jack Daniels. Do I thought I’d try a Tennessee style whisky. Two things I should’ve noticed before I bought. First, age statement is “at least one year”. Second it’s only 80 proof. Nose is strong yeast. Taste was yeasty and thin. The filtering through the maple charcoal did little for smoothing or enhancing the flavor. I’ll see if they let a 2 star review through.",Not For Me

Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,"I have tried this before simply because it was priced at a point where you don't mind buying some to try it. I was very impressed. I now buy a bottle whenever I see some.

Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,"I was looking for a pretty cheap whiskey, but I was afraid that going with the cheapest bottle would leave me unsatisfied with my purchase.

Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,"I have purchased several cases of Lonehand over that past year since I live a few hours away from a Total wine.

Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,I'm not sure why I put a question mark as this is for SURE the worst bourbon I've ever had.

Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,"Bought this after tasting in store. Compared it to THE quintessential Tennessee whiskey, the (until now) the incomparable Jack Daniels. This --- to me at least --- tastes exactly the same. Smooth, mellow, & no ""bite."". Make no mistake, other than costing $5 less than JD, this is a fine whiskey. One that will replace JD on my bar.",Great Charcoal Filtered TENNESSEE Whiskey - JD!
Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,I tasted this at the store and was told it was pretty much a dupe of Jack Daniels. It seemed okay and I bought it. The bottle shape looks the same. Later I compared the two at home and I find Lonehand harsh in comparison.,Just Okay

Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,kind of a so-so taste maybe good for mixing for the price. I drink it with water and ice so not especially to my liking.,Not Bad For The Cost
Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,This whiskey is smooth! Very good sipping - deadly mixing. Mixing this whiskey with lemonade 60/40 tastes kind of like an Arnold Palmer (no artificial sweeteners version). You have no idea there is booze in the mix. That's why I'm calling it deadly. Not in a bad way. One can get carried away drinking that mix. I've tried it multiple times with two different bottles. Same outcome. I had my friend who doesn't like whiskey try the mix and she was shocked with the taste. I do want to reiterate it's good sipping strait too. I do recommend this whiskey I will buy again!,Deadly!

Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,The store hand did describe it to me exactly how it tasted. Smooth like Jack but does have an alcohol bite. It is a good whiskey and maybe i'm not too familiar with sour mash but would definitely buy again. Great for the price!,Smooth But Does Pack A Punch
Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,"Disclaimer: This was my first Sour Mash I've tried (just wanted to try something new). I bought this a few weeks ago and have had trouble making a dent in it.

Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,I've drank JD since I was legal. My wife who can only have a little wine for medical reasons will ask to smell it before I drink it.

Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,Never second guess yourself. Being retired and looking to budget my money I bought a big bottle for 26 and change. Got home and got scared as I love my Jack so I went back to the store to exchange it. The manager told me to try it and if I didn’t like it to return it for a full refund. I didn’t even like the sniff test. It was awful and I poured it down the sink honestly. Expensive lesson. Trust your own instincts at all times. Jack Daniels all the way.,Awful

Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,"If Jack Daniels were to provide a knockoff brand for Walmart, this would be it. But that’s ok! The makers of JD used the same bottle-shape to vessel this step-cousin of Jack. By itself, it lacks the sweetness that JD promises in each sip, but it has a harsher bite. However, as a mixer, it works very well, packing justvthe right punch to any soda or even iced tea.

Her son rants and raves about it but he is a New Orleans Firefighter and those guys will drink anything. Looking beyond the reviews and the negative press, here is my honest review. I am a newcomer to whiskey. I am a regular to bourbons like Elijah Craig and Knob creek. This sour mash whiskey is closer to a sour dough bread than it is whiskey. On the nose I get the vanilla with a hint of bread. The taste is purely alcohol with more of that sour dough bread. No Vanilla notes. There is no finish or lingering taste. Just the alcohol burn and it tastes like I didn't even try anything. It's just not good. Save your money for something better. I am going to keep it as a mixer and get on writing that thank you note for the gift but I am not a fan.",It'S Just Not Good..
Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,"These ""Spirits Direct"" products (ABC FW&S also has a similarly named ""Direct To You"" line) are just awful proprietary products purchased directly from distiller's whose products aren't good enough quality to be mass distributed by the big dogs.

The vast majority of them are trash but there's the occasional good one.

Almost always some trash proprietary product they make commission on due to gross profits over the national brands.",Spirits Direct Almost Always Means Bad.
Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,"I decided to try something new tonight, and this was marked as a ""Yvonne Recommendation"" so I figured why not? I was skeptical considering it's $14.99, but sometimes there's some gems to be had in the lower cost selections. Oy vey. This is definitely not Jack or a Jack equivalent. Taste wise it's harsh, with a nasty bite and a strange after taste even with Coke as a mixer. That being said, I think I can make this work if I pair it with some of my less expensive every day cigars. It's certainly not something I'd put alongside a Patel, Gurka, or Fuente, but I can see (taste?) it working with some of my value priced Thompson Cigar every day samplers. For the price I paid, it's about what I expected. It's not the worst I've ever had, but it most definitely isn't the same quality as a Jack Daniels and no one who purchases this should expect it to be. Since maybe isn't an option for the would you recommend this to a friend question I'm marking yes, but with the caveat that you don't expect a lot from it, use a mixer, and manage your expectations accordingly.",You Get What You Paid For

Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,I tried this over ice first with no mixer and couldn't drink it due to sweetness. I hoped I could mix it with coke (diet coke actually) but that didn't work either.

Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,Got two samples of this and have had it 1 other time since and each and every time I would have rather poured it out.

Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,"EVERYONE: If you are looking for a cheaper version of Jack Daniels, THIS IS NOT IT! Lone Hand is not in the same realm as Jack Daniels. I would call Jack good, but not great. I would call Lone Hand bottom of the barrel trash. For only a few dollars more, you are far better off getting a bottle of Jack Daniels. But if you're going to buy any bourbon at that price point (yes, Jack Daniels is technically a bourbon whiskey), do yourself a favor and get a bottle of 1792 or Elijah Craig. You'll get a spectacular product for a similar price, instead of only saving 3 or 4 bucks and getting a bottle of garbage that you'll rather give away than finish yourself. And if you REALLY need to save the money, get a bottle of Ezra Brooks. It isn't the same exact flavor as Jack, (neither is Lone Hand) but if you're looking for cheap good whiskey (especially bourbon whiskey) you aren't going to find a better deal than Ezra Brooks.",Garbage Product Masquerading As Jack Daniels

Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,Tried this in store before I bought it and was very surprised with how smooth it was considering the reviews I’ve seen. It’s not overly complex but most Tennessee whiskeys aren’t imo. I get a little Carmel with no burn at all.

Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,"I thought it was going to be bad considering the scathing reviews by some. It wasn't bad but, you may as well pay the price difference and get some Jack Daniels.",Not Bad
Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,"A nice, easy drinking whisky. Great with coke or ginger ale!",Nice Whisky
Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,"I expected a certain sweet edge to this as it is a Tennessee whiskey, but the flavor borders on a liqueur. You mention that it is maple-filtered; the bottle makes it clear that the wood is sugar maple, which might well explain the taste. At its price I might consider it for a mixed drink, but not as a sippin' whiskey.","""Sweet""Heart Of The Rodeo?"
Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,"Wow...hard to imagine a worse whiskey experience. Had to give it one star in order to review, but it's a ""no star"" for me. Nose is heavy on solvent and mustiness. Color is pale...straw-like, rather than a deep brown. Absolutely no legs in the glass...watery in texture. Favor is faintly present...harsh, no mid-palate, finish is like water. If you want something that tastes like Jack Daniels, then buy Jack Daniels. The Lonehand is only slightly cheaper than Jack Daniels and not even remotely close in quality. Might be worth purchasing a bottle as a collectible as I expect that it will be off the market soon...at least in it's present packaging. The parent company of Jack Daniels is suing the Lonehand brand for trademark and ""trade dress"" violations. Note the bottle shape and label. The idea is to make you think you're buying Jack Daniels for a discount, but you're getting plonk.",Stunningly Poor
Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,"Compared to Jack Daniels by a store employee (but at a bargain price!). This is to Jack Daniels what a pogo stick is to a BMW. Avoid. I wouldn’t make whiskey sour with this stuff. Further, it inclines me to shoo away store employees trying to offer guidance on anything beverage related. If your buyer made a mistake, punish the buyer not the customers.",Swill
Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,"Admittedly, I was a bit skeptical when I saw the price, but they said it was better than Jack (not that that's too difficult), so I thought I'd try it. And I was not disappointed. While I usually prefer a bit more oak & spice in my whiskey, Lonehand certainly has far more complexity & depth than its one-dimensional older brother. Notes of sweet vanilla on the nose carry over to the palate, where a bouquet of rich caramel & fresh fruit joins the ensemble. The finish is quite smooth & long—the taste of honeycrisp apple lingered on my tongue for several minutes. As I hinted earlier, this would not be my first choice of whiskey (nor would it be my second), but I'm not sorry I bought it. If you're looking for a good, cheap Tennessee whiskey, I would suggest giving this a try, if nothing else. Who knows: you may find a new everyday go-to.",A Pleasant Surprise...
Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,"I bought a 750 of this on whim at the register to see if it was an adequate substitute for Jack Daniels. I should have gone with a couple of the airline-sized bottles instead and saved a few bucks. I've tried it neat, on the rocks, and chilled. It has been awful in every presentation. The initial wash across the tastebuds is unpleasant and the aftertaste is worse. I don't mix soda with any brown liquor, so I guess that some cola could cover up the nasty flavor and account for the positive reviews. The remainder is going down the drain. I'd be ashamed to even offer this at parties to people who don't know any better.",Awful
Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,"I usually rotate around between George Dickel No.12, Bellemeade Sour Mash Bourbon, and Woodford Reserve Double Oak. I don't mix and I usually drink my whiskey neat. I say that so you have some idea of my taste in whiskey. This is definitely sweeter than the others I mentioned. You can definitely pick up the maple flavor. It is pretty smooth going down. The price makes this a real bargain occasional change-of-pace whiskey.",Decent Whiskey - Great Price
Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,"Pleasant aroma on the nose. Not incredibly smooth, but smooth enough to sip on the rocks. Slightly harsh but sweet and pleasant finish. I do not find any vanilla, but there certainly is a sweet caramel like finish.",Good For The Price
Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,Do not recommend this as a cheaper alternative to Jack Daniels. Weird aftertaste even with a mixer. If I could return this I would.,Never Again
Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,"Lonehand was a hit at my last party. Mixed with cola, my friends were all asking to try a Lo-Co! :)",A New Drink Is Born!
Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,"I tried this as a cheaper alternative to Jack. I should have stuck with Evan Williams. This whiskey does not appeal to me. I have tried it chilled, on the rocks, with water, neat and out of the freezer. Stuff that comes out of a plastic bottle tastes better. Just not for me. There’s an aftertaste that I can’t describe, But there are no hints of vanilla or caramel, doesn’t even go good with a cigar.",Oy Vie
Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,"This is my new favorite low cost whiskey. I normally drink all my Scotch, whiskey, and Bourbon neat and straight from the shelf. This one I had to chill it to enjoy it. It wasn't that good plain neat. Again, not on the rocks, just chilled and enjoy.",Really Good When Chilled
Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,"is the worst whiskey or bourbon i have ever had. taste like ....a word that total wine wont let me post, even with coke. i only tried because of the 2 reviews listed above and i have no clue what they are talking about. this is pure urine in a bottle . i will not even give this to people i dont like . its bad ... bad......bad. do not buy unless its a joke gift i will be dumping out ...its that bad",Horrible
Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,"Picked this up after an in store tasting. Not disappointed! Smooth, low burn, high flavor whiskey. You certainly can't beat the price. This may be my new go to.",Great Flavor At Any Price Point
Lonehand Whiskey 1.75l,Smooth and sweet. LONEHAND is a better whiskey with a little mixer or even something to enjoy on the rocks. Cheaper than JD and with a ton more favor!,Much Better Than Jack!

Shimauta 10 Yr Ryukyu Japanese Whisky 750ml,"I'd consider myself a beginner on my Japanese Whiskey journey, and I am so glad I stumbled across this unique one. Sweet and buttery, with notes of caramel, roasted wood, liquorice and spices such as cloves and cinnamon. Fun to try and will buy again!",Unique Whiskey With Beautiful Flavors
Shimauta 10 Yr Ryukyu Japanese Whisky 750ml,"I didn't get much off the nose at first. I went in not really knowing what to expect. But on the palate, it's entirely mushrooms up front. Sauted Cremini mushrooms I kid you not. There's mint and floral notes on the finish, but with every sip, I get slammed with mushrooms first thing. Some people are going to find this really interesting. But I hate mushrooms with burning white hot intensity. So this was not for me.","Well, It'S Definitely Unique..."

Skatterbrain Peanut Butter Whiskey 750ml,"If there's whiskey in this, it is well hidden underneath many layers of intensely sweet, artificial nut flavor.

Skatterbrain Peanut Butter Whiskey 750ml,"Bought a 50ml just to try before buying a full 750ml. I was surprised how much I liked it.

Johnnie Walker Blue Label 750ml,,
Johnnie Walker Blue Label 750ml,"A lot of older reviews say the blend has changed, which I get what they don’t like about the new blend, their saying it feels like an entry level scotch with how mellow it is. I find the flavor to be very supple, and a blend of 27 whiskeys giving it a wide variety of flavor where I can’t taste one rising above the rest like the Smokey flavor of black label does, however it’s so much smoother than black label, which is my favorite scotch. I bought a 200 ml bottle, tastes great, so I bought a 750. The box it comes in is so ugly and I’m going to prank my dad on his birthday by putting his present inside. The blue bottle itself looks kind of weird, even though brown and blue are opposite on the color wheel and therefore it should be the most visually appealing bottle, it reminds me of a toilet bowl of diarrhea with some toilet bowl cleaner in there. I ironically like to drink this stuff out of a blue glass to stay on theme. It’s true that it’s artificially expensive by becoming intentionally rare, I don’t think 1/10K casks stand out so much that it’s the only one worthy of being in the blue blend. With the one in 10K worthiness rating, it’s obvious they wanted to make a cheaper replica of sorts that’s more accessible to the general population in blends like Gold and Green. A lot of people who drink gold and green have also tried blue, many say they’re on par with eachother and it likely comes down to the 1/10K cask artificial rarity vs all the other casks that were equally as delicious but didn’t make the narrow cut, probably got turned into gold and Green. I love black and it tastes like a totally different product, I love both of these, but the research tells me, I’d you like this blue label, Green and Gold are worthy maidens who won’t slurp the money out your wallet",Different Product From The Black

I didn't know anything about it, other than the fact that ""Blue"" label is supposed to be their top class, way above their (terrible) Red Label that is popular on airlines, and their Black label which I found just as underwhelming as the even more famous Jack Daniels BL. Well, before I got around to googling up the astounding $200/bottle price of this ""Blue"" label, I had already had 2-3 servings at the proud behest of my host, and I found myself distinctly unimpressed. Mind you, there was nothing BAD about it, nothing OBJECTIONABLE, but neither was there anything I'd ever want to write home about. Just a big bland, ""so what???"" kind of whiskey. Honest to gods, I'd happily take my $30 Bulleit, Knob Creek or Redemption Rye over this stuff ANY day.",Price-Driven PLACEBO EFFECT??? Not Impressed.

Johnnie Walker Blue Label 750ml,"It is a drink that I invite you to taste, its years of experience says it all and its taste confirms it",
Johnnie Walker Blue Label 750ml,"I occasionally buy this bottle because I like to have an ""alternative"" mild smoky scotch in my collection that is perfect when I want to drink something with a good balance, ""conversational"" without missing quality and complexity. I have to say that I always had a good experience considering what I was expecting, thanks to the equilibrium between the smokiness, fruitiness, and creaminess that this spirit was delivering. I was appreciating the complex and dynamic changes from tropical fruity notes at the beginning, progressively going toward more darker tones at mid palate. Even if the experience was ending with a short finish, the spirit was always leaving with the desire to drink more from the bottle, witch was a winner point. On the other hands, I feel this new bottle ( remarkably increased in price), delivers a very different experience toward a cheaper and unsophisticated direction. The aroma at the nose it is still wonderful and it is probably the only positive side of it, and even if bottled at 40% abv it taste bolder and heavier than the previous bottles I owned, but again not in a positive way as I will explain. This new bottling of JW blue tastes remarkably oily and mono-dimensional, missing the dynamic changes I remember from the beginning to the end, living you with an overall ""cheap and flat/boring"" taste starting in a way and not developing. it doesn't taste bad, but it is really boring. It almost looks like they added too much grain whisky (inexpensive ) maybe to create more creaminess and to save money, completely overriding the magic rollercoaster experience of dynamic complexity provided by the old blends used that I remember . The overall result it still remains pleasant, but it doesn't keep your interest alive enough to ask for more, and especially doesn't justify this price point. For me it is absolutely a no. I would rather buy for half of the price a great single malt blend like Mackinlay's rare old or stick to the way cheaper Johnnie walker green for about 1/4 of the price, with a splash of water in the glass to open up the flavor and smoothen up the experience.",Very Disappointed.

For my personal taste, you could get a similar nose and palate on quite a few single malt or blended scotch for 10% to 30% of the price tag. Why waste your money on a full bottle then?

Johnnie Walker Blue Label 750ml,Tell me Im wrong. Nobody does it better than Johnnie. & thats something my daddy taught me.,
Johnnie Walker Blue Label 750ml,Yes it’s expensive. But if you are looking in this price range Blue is definitely an easy choice. I’ve had pretty much every offering of scotch in the $100-$200 range and this is definitely worth the money. People hating on the price probably shouldn’t be spending this much on a bottle to being with IJS.,Excellent

Johnnie Walker Blue Label 750ml,"Ill start off by saying Im typically not a whiskey drinker. I bought this for my man as part of his birthday gift - he absolutely loved it and so did I. Its the type of drink you absolutely do not need a chaser for. Im at the stage of my life where I would take a shot and still chase with soda or have a mixed drink, but it would be a waste to lose those delicious smokey notes in Johnnie Walker Blue Label by following up with a soda. It tastes good without needing to be chilled, and I might add it tastes slightly better at room temp than cold in my preference. I can see why people would spend upwards of $40 per shot for this, as that was how I actually tried it for the first time - instantly fell in love at how this spirit was able to make you actually enjoy the flavors. Bottle is stunning, I love the way its packaged and the colors - super lush. Taking the actual drink theres no cringeyness, no grossed out facial expressions, just a nice smooth drink. Dont get me wrong, it definitely packs a punch, but in the best way possible!",

Johnnie Walker Blue Label 750ml,"I have had this a few times (I'm fortunate my uncle owns a liquor store). If it gifted to me, I would definitely drink it; but if I had to purchase it myself, would not buy it. I think it is overpriced for what it is. There are plenty of brands that taste similar in terms of flavor and smoothness that cost less. If I had to choose from Johnny Walker I'd rather spend my money on green or gold label.",

Johnnie Walker Blue Label 750ml,"I like JW blue. Is it my favorite JW? No, the Green is but JWB is some solid stuff. Initial nose was zero alcohol mature grains/malt. Some smoke and sherry with some distant muddled nuts and fruits. Heavier on the smoke side though. The dram finished smooth but medium short in length. It’s reminiscent of Bowmore 18 with less smoke but not as complex and not better for my personal tastes. The Bowmore 18 is fairly light in the smoke for an Islay but the fruits and sweetness come through better than this. JWB is still top shelf stuff 91/100",Nice Work JW!
Johnnie Walker Blue Label 750ml,"We bring this out for celebrations or to get our friends to try it. The bottle and box are beautiful and makes a statement when you bring it out.

Johnnie Walker Blue Label 750ml,"My favourite whisky of all time. Forget about price, this is the one I want to drink. The only whisky that has ever come close was six-times the price of Blue Label - makes Blue Label very drinkable everyday.",
Johnnie Walker Blue Label 750ml,"As many other reviews mention, this is about as smooth and drinkable a whisky as one can find. However, praising a whisky for ""smooth and drinkable"" is like praising a steak merely for being ""tender."" Okay, fine, it's drinkable and smooth, but why else would I want it? As it turns out, there's not much more reason to want Johnnie Walker Blue, other than (perhaps) cachet. It tastes and feel like it's been blended primarily for drinkability, rather than interest--intentionally unoffensive. Unfortunately, the cost of offending no one is settling for an experience that thrills very few. In the end, it's an extravagant treat for the casual drinker. No matter how smooth or ""drinkable"" this whisky might be, in the end you are buying a label more than a whisky. One -almost- could call it ""entry level,"" if it weren't a $200+ bottle. Of course, it's a good deal better than an ""entry level"" whisky. In fact, Johnnie Walker Blue does taste quite good. However, it's a perfect example of how price and quality don't always go hand in hand. It's a very good blend, but there are many, many Scotch whiskys (blends and single malts) that I prefer (some strongly) but at half or even a quarter of the price (not the least of which is Johnnie Walker Green). There just isn't much to savor. So, it's certainly worth a try. Go in on a bottle with a few buddies or pony up for a shot at a bar. It's an extravagant gesture, or a ""wow factor"" gift, but keep the recipient in mind (the recipient may very well prefer something much less expensive).","Great, But Far Overpriced"
Johnnie Walker Blue Label 750ml,"One of my favorite Scotches! I always keep a bottle of it in my liquor cabinet. It's so tasty and smooth. I personally mix 7up and put a lemon slice in it. Its packaging is very good, worth every penny. I highly recommend this product for your liquor cabinet.",

McFarlane'S Reserve Kentucky Straight Bourbon 1.75l,"What I love about this bourbon is between the soft mouthfeel, the gentle sweetness from the wheated mash bill, and the fact that it’s higher proof, it can stand up in a cocktail and carry its weight—it makes an excellent old fashioned—but it’s also delicious neat or on the rocks. I really like it in a Kentucky Mule, where those sweeter dark fruit and grain notes balance perfectly with the spicy kick of ginger beer.",Perfect For Any Occasion
McFarlane'S Reserve Kentucky Straight Bourbon 1.75l,"Like many of the other reviewers, I was coaxed to try this bourbon as it compared favorably against Weller. I taste tested from a 750ml bottle and have to say it was a little hot but okay. The flavor was a bit thin, but I could pick up the vanilla and caramel, not too bad.  I decided to buy the 1.75l bottle. Bad idea. I should have bought the bottle I tasted. I opened my bottle last night after finishing a small batch bourbon. My first taste of the Mcfarlane was not only hot but weirdly tasted a bit like tequila. I wonder if the difference between what I originally tasted and this bottle is due to perhaps resetting the bottling line for 1.75L and using a different batch? I tried it again this afternoon, and no tequila flavor but definitely not comparable to Weller, nor the bottle I tasted in the store..... I think if this was given another 12 months of aging, it would possibly be a Weller contender, but we'll never know. My recommendation is to buy the smaller bottle for sure if you still want to try it.",There Are Better Bourbons For The Money

McFarlane'S Reserve Kentucky Straight Bourbon 1.75l,"The opening nose was not huge, but it had a nice color from aging. The normal vanilla and fruit tastes that come with most bourbons wasn’t there. The lingering taste most bourbons have wasn’t there either. It’s taken me some time to process the taste. It reminds me of a very young bourbon with undeveloped sweetness and flavors mixed with a small amount of better taste to give some kind of color and nose. Even cheaper bar bourbons have some minor traces of vanilla and flavors this bourbon was void of them. I wouldn’t recommend this bourbon even as a mixer just a disappointment I was hoping for more with all the hype",A Disappointment

McFarlane'S Reserve Kentucky Straight Bourbon 1.75l,"Bourbon is a personal taste. I'm a Buffalo Trace, Knob Creek type. This was recommended by a staff member at Total Wines. It's not my preference, but it looks like a lot of others like it. Not high end, but not bad for the price. What I didn't care for was a strong alcohol finish/after taste. I prefer a smoother finish.",Maybe OK In A Mixed Drink
McFarlane'S Reserve Kentucky Straight Bourbon 1.75l,"It’s eh. It’s not great, it’s not awful, it’s definitely not rot gut. But, it’s nothing to be excited about. Store employee really tried selling me on it. I bought in and tried it, he told me “since you’re a Weller guy, you’ll love this” it’s nothing like Weller, I’d put this in the category of plastic bottle bourbon dressed up in a glass bottle. It’s really not good. But like I said, it’s not horrible. I’ve got a very expensive collection, some bottles with several hundred, some worth $15. This doesn’t really fit in with anything I have.",Eh
McFarlane'S Reserve Kentucky Straight Bourbon 1.75l,,Smooth And Fragrant
McFarlane'S Reserve Kentucky Straight Bourbon 1.75l,"Okay $22 bottle if better they would charge more. Very knowledgeable bourbon store employee said it won blind taste test against Weller. So I compared to my current open bottle of 1792, which has high rye mash bill. The 1792 is way smoother. A fair test ?? Try a bottle, everyone has different taste. Just don’t bring to party to impress bourbon lovers. Total Wine wins 5stars for bourbon selections.",Store Recommed New Brand From Danville Ky

McFarlane'S Reserve Kentucky Straight Bourbon 1.75l,"The first thing I look for when trying a new bourbon, is there a ""Bite"" or sharpness to it. Happily, McFarlane's Reserve passed the test. I found it to be smoother than Maker's Mark (one of my favorites), but not as smooth as Angel's Envy.","No ""Bite"""

McFarlane'S Reserve Kentucky Straight Bourbon 1.75l,I bought this while in Daytona Beach and was featured at the liquor store. Not good to drink neat or on the rocks. Might be good with soda,Okay Bourbon
McFarlane'S Reserve Kentucky Straight Bourbon 1.75l,"We bought this whiskey after reading the pleasant-sounding description cards with the intent of putting it in cocktails. Alone, the whiskey has a harsh bite that almost tastes like some kind of industrial solvent. It lacks any smooth, caramel or vanilla notes that we were hoping to find. In cocktails, the whiskey overpowers good amaros and other additives, making mixing with it an exercise in mitigation of its unpleasant flavor.",Not A Great Whiskey

McFarlane'S Reserve Kentucky Straight Bourbon 1.75l,"One of the best value, good bourbon I’ve tasted.",Excellent Affordable Bourbon
McFarlane'S Reserve Kentucky Straight Bourbon 1.75l,"To start... it says it's a minimum of 3yo.! Which means it ""could have"" 4yo mixed in the batch ? But there is something about the finish, it was a hair too much cinnamon & the maker says it has a ""clean"" finish. It's more of a ethanol/medicinal ""clean"" finish. It really should be closer to the $15 to $17 range. Evan Williams white label is a minimum 4yo. (could have 5yo mixed in the batch), plus EW is a BIB, 100 proof ! The McFarlane is a wheater, & supposed to be sweeter than bourbon. But the EW 100 BIB, is a bourbon and it's smoother a touch sweeter and cheaper !!!","It'S Just Ok... Could Be Smoother, If It Was Older"
McFarlane'S Reserve Kentucky Straight Bourbon 1.75l,"I hoped this would be a good fill-in for when Two Stars is not in stock, but it is a little more harsh (like it should be a economy purchase), but better than most. For a few dollars less, I'd keep a bottle around.","OK, But Could Be Smoother."

McFarlane'S Reserve Kentucky Straight Bourbon 1.75l,"This bourbon was a bit of a let down. The flavor profile is more Scotch (you get peat, and no barrel character) than bourbon, let alone a wheated bourbon. I would pass on this one and pick up Rebel Yell, Larceny Or Makers.",Let Down.

McFarlane'S Reserve Kentucky Straight Bourbon 1.75l,"Not nearly as smooth as I had hoped. Satisfactory in mixed drink but you can get a mixed drink bourbon for half this price.

McFarlane'S Reserve Kentucky Straight Bourbon 1.75l,Great flavor...very smooth,Great Buy...!!!!
McFarlane'S Reserve Kentucky Straight Bourbon 1.75l,"It has the same flavor profile as Weller. A little more bite in the aftertaste due to a more oaky flavor and acidity, but still a good example of wheated bourbon.

McFarlane'S Reserve Kentucky Straight Bourbon 1.75l,"I wasn't expecting much from this when I got it, but it's not very often you find a wheated bourbon readily available other than Maker's. The 3 year age statement shows...and not in a good way in my opinion. The nose is fruity and scotch-like, showing the lack of aging and barrel influence. The pallet follows through with the fruity notes, which comes from the grains. Not much to speak of with the finish either. I have no use for this product. Will give it an extra star for being a wheated bourbon, but really does need some more age on it. This MIGHT be okay for transitioning a scotch drinker to bourbon, but you're flipping a coin on the response from that. There are better options readily available. I'd drink standard Maker's Mark over this every single day.","Young, Scotch-Like Bourbon"

Bulleit Bourbon 1.75l,"I’ve been trying different bourbons for about the past year, attempting to discover what fits my palette best. I’m a huge Widow Jane 10-year fan. I must admit that considering the simple hints of cherry and vanilla that hit strongest at the beginning, ending with a buttery smooth caramel tinge, the complexity is super impressive. Especially considering this price point. I drink my bourbon with a couple cubes of ice. I’ve had all sorts of bourbons from Four Roses, EH Taylor, Blantons (amazing BTW), to Heavens Door and Angels Envy over the past 6-8 months. Bulleit doesn’t put them all to shame but dang if it doesn’t give each of them a run for their money. Whatever Bulleit does in their distillation process, it works, and works wonders. There’s a reason this bourbon is so highly rated by customers. Do yourself a favor and grab a bottle. Even if it’s just your Friday night mixer. For an extra $4 over the Jack Daniels, I can only imagine how much better this would be...for those who like their bourbon mixed.",Diamond In The Rough

Woodford Reserve 750ml,"I recently had the opportunity to taste a bourbon that costs $1100 a fifth (a friend brought it over). It was excellent, and for comparison we also sampled Woodford Reserve, which I happened to have. The $1100 bourbon was excellent, but we both felt that it was only very slightly better than the Woodford. At over 27 times the price of the Woodford, it was a perfect demonstration of the law of diminishing returns. Woodford is a truly superior whiskey at a price most can afford.",An Outstanding Bourbon At An Affordable Price

Woodford Reserve 750ml,"Nose: Apple, vanilla, brown sugar, feeling rich and sweet. Also a little rye with some hint of oak. With water, there's more vanilla with caramel.  Palate: A little harsh, not unbearable but somehow the sting on the tongue and palate feels too long. Prominent oak at the same time. There's a note of malty sweetness. With some drops of water, the aggression on the tongue is suppressed, feeling like pepper. The liquor tastes a lot sweeter.  Finish: Dry, apple, no astringency. Feeling clean.  Comment: This bourbon has beautiful nose. It's a nice orderly demonstration of everything it has to offer. With that impressive maroon color, it builds up high expectation before you taste. Unfortunately, this turns out to be a simple bourbon without too much depth to overcome the harshness on the palate. Note, this is not to say it's a bad drink. This is still a decent bourbon if it's slightly watered down or with rock. Then you get an easy plain sweet dram without any unpleasant feelings. However, such a character normally makes me associate with mixer. It also makes me wonder why bother such a specific proof number, and feel the product is a bit over priced compared to other very good bourbons in $2x range.","Great Nose, But So-So On Palate"

Woodford Reserve 750ml,I don’t agree with any negative reviews on this quality bourbon. Right from the start I love the personality of Woodford. Before the 1st sip I noticed woody sweet floral notes and a nice finish. Sure it has a little bite to it because it’s a bourbon and not a soft drink. I’m only giving it a four because it’s the best I’ve ever had and I’ve never had a 5 star. I will compare with higher rated bourbons so it may move up. Great work Woodford.,Love It!

And you get is a high quality delightful bourbon.. Smooth with the right amount of burn.. 10 out of 10,Simply Delightful
WhistlePig 10 Year Private Rye Barrel Select 750ml,The first pour came across a little hot. Not much flavor. Came back to it a week later and wow what a difference it made. Great rye flavors thick with a great finish. This pick was at 106 proof very enjoyable sipper,Let It Open Up Before You Make A Judgement

WhistlePig 10 Year Private Rye Barrel Select 750ml,"I stepped up and bought the single barrel after 3 bottles of the 10 year which is great also but this is now my new favorite , even better than blantons and single barrel four roses , well worth the price","Excellent, Smooth And A Kick"

WhistlePig 10 Year Private Rye Barrel Select 750ml,"I bought this as a gift for my whiskey loving friend at the recommendation of an employee. Here is his review: “Enticing spicy honey notes on the nose. Cloves, cinnamon, and citrus on the palate. Warms up in your mouth and tingles a little. Perfect heat when drank straight. Like a tide of flavor in your mouth but finishes smooth. One of the best Ryes at this price I’ve had. A drop of water opens the sweetness but I prefer it hot and dry”",Detailed Review

WhistlePig 10 Year Private Rye Barrel Select 750ml,I got it for my boyfriend for graduating with his Master's degree because its one of his favorite drinks. He loved it! I got it the next day and the service was fantastic,Good Price And Service
WhistlePig 10 Year Private Rye Barrel Select 750ml,At 117 proof its hot and will kick you. But once you get past the alcohol it is the best flavor I have had in any rye. Lots of carmel with some vanilla notes and just enough spice. Really great and now my favorite rye although at $74 I won't be buying it often. Saved for special occasions only.,Fantastic Taste
WhistlePig 10 Year Private Rye Barrel Select 750ml,"Bordering on turpentine - maybe it’s just me, but not to my liking - especially for the price",Very Oaky
WhistlePig 10 Year Private Rye Barrel Select 750ml,"I haven’t had the non-select version to compare it to, but I can say that this is an absolutely lovely whiskey. The ABV was much higher than the standard whistle pig (117 proof) but it did not come off as overly sharp. The profile was on the sweet side, but with a lingering warm aftertaste. The only reason I give it four stars, is that it’s about $15 more than it should be. But it still is a great whiskey. Try to find a tasting and try it before you get it.",Lovely Whiskey

I highly highly recommend all JD lovers to take the trip to Lynchburg, TN. See the product you love being created. See the 10 feet of charcoal every drop gets filtered through. The vast amount of product and volume distilled and to keep that amount consistently great is something to marvel about and appreciate. Go to the Distillery that Jack built. Bucket list destination.

There were no subtle notes of honey, vanilla, and faint clover. Just an overwhelming nose of what has to be algae. Absolutely horrible. My fiancé has relegated this bottle to only being palatable, when mixed with sour. And then she still smells algae. It also has to be at minimum, the second cocktail of the night.... We can’t imagine whoever “hand bottled” the one we purchased didn’t notice the terrible odor. We won’t be taking a chance on another Whistle pig product again.

It's good but if you want to something super special buy the WhistlePig 111 if you can find it...it's almost always the same price as it's proof...$111.00.

After reading the glowing reviews about the complexities, the smoothness and all the good essences there were supposedly for my mouth to enjoy I bought a bottle. Eagerly I opened it, poured some out and smelled. The nose was promisingly gentle so I sipped. All I could feel, or taste was the acrid bite. It burned my mouth and my throat and when it hit my stomach it continued the burn all through the night. Maybe this caters to those who love an enormous burn, and if so, this is your rye. But for me I want something that allows all parts of my mouth, nose and throat to discover all it has to offer. All the tastes and aromas from the obvious to the the delicate.

Some have been pleasant surprises and actually tasted better than more expensive bourbons. This one was an exception. It smells great on the nose. There is not much flavor on the palate and the finish resembled turpentine. It was rather disappointing. This appears to be a product of one of the mega-companies with no known source. This is NOT a Tennessee whiskey and is a disgrace to using the term. There are much cheaper bourbons on the shelf that are much better including Very Old Barton or even Old Fitzgerald.

Lonehand Whiskey 750ml,I was a bit pleased to see that this one is a nice drink. Great aroma hints of caramel and vanilla with a tad bit of smoke. Filtered through sugar maple charcoal it comes off with just a wee bit of sweetness upfront. Let it linger on the tongue and you'll get the warmth and spice of cinnamon. Tickles the tongue and lips and has a nice even warmth finish. A smooth drink with not a lot of heat or bitterness. It's not up there in my top ten but is is a good drink that I would not refuse if offered.

Lonehand Whiskey 750ml,"This whiskey's taste seemed watery, lacking depth or complexity, and generally very underwhelming to me; not sure if it's the bottle I got, a problem with the batch, or something else. What made it worse was it had a artificial 'maple syrup' flavor present that, while faint, was still enough to be distracting even when mixed. Coupled together, these factors made it a grueling and unpleasant slog through the rest of the bottle (and we still ended up abandoning about 1/10 of it at the bottom anyway). Though I got it on sale in-store ($25) and on recommendation from a store representative, I just can't get past the taste. I would much rather buy Ezra Brooks, which is $10 cheaper and whose flavor is twice as good.","Weird Flavor, Poor Value"

One that will replace JD on my bar.",Great Charcoal Filtered TENNESSEE Whiskey - JD!

Lonehand Whiskey 750ml,This whiskey is smooth! Very good sipping - deadly mixing. Mixing this whiskey with lemonade 60/40 tastes kind of like an Arnold Palmer (no artificial sweeteners version). You have no idea there is booze in the mix. That's why I'm calling it deadly. Not in a bad way. One can get carried away drinking that mix. I've tried it multiple times with two different bottles. Same outcome. I had my friend who doesn't like whiskey try the mix and she was shocked with the taste. I do want to reiterate it's good sipping strait too. I do recommend this whiskey I will buy again!,Deadly!

Lonehand Whiskey 750ml,"...at all of the reviews trashing this fine sipping Tennessee whiskey. As far as I'm concerned, the writers of those reviews have ZERO credibility. No, it doesn't taste like gasoline or nail polish remover. The front end is sweet, it is light-bodied and the finish is smooth with little to no ""peppery fade"". Yes, it is a young whiskey and not as complex as an aged product. If what you want is JACK, then just buy JACK.

Lonehand Whiskey 750ml,"Marketed as a less expensive substitute for Jack Daniel’s Old No.7, this whiskey falls short. It is probably fine as a mixer, but it if you drink TN whiskey on the rocks or near, pay the additional price for Jack Daniel’s No.7",Disappointing Jack Daniel’S Knockoff

Lonehand Whiskey 750ml,"I saw the negative reviews. I was gifted this for Christmas from an extended family member. Her son rants and raves about it but he is a New Orleans Firefighter and those guys will drink anything. Looking beyond the reviews and the negative press, here is my honest review. I am a newcomer to whiskey. I am a regular to bourbons like Elijah Craig and Knob creek. This sour mash whiskey is closer to a sour dough bread than it is whiskey. On the nose I get the vanilla with a hint of bread. The taste is purely alcohol with more of that sour dough bread. No Vanilla notes. There is no finish or lingering taste. Just the alcohol burn and it tastes like I didn't even try anything. It's just not good. Save your money for something better. I am going to keep it as a mixer and get on writing that thank you note for the gift but I am not a fan.",It'S Just Not Good..
Lonehand Whiskey 750ml,"These ""Spirits Direct"" products (ABC FW&S also has a similarly named ""Direct To You"" line) are just awful proprietary products purchased directly from distiller's whose products aren't good enough quality to be mass distributed by the big dogs. That's not to say there's not the occasional gem to be found; but when buying these spirits you really are taking a gamble. It's like searching the $5 DVD bin at Walmart. The vast majority of them are trash but there's the occasional good one. Unless you must try different things, stay far far far away from anything labeled an employee favorite or a ""direct"" product. Almost always some trash proprietary product they make commission on due to gross profits over the national brands.",Spirits Direct Almost Always Means Bad.
Lonehand Whiskey 750ml,"I decided to try something new tonight, and this was marked as a ""Yvonne Recommendation"" so I figured why not? I was skeptical considering it's $14.99, but sometimes there's some gems to be had in the lower cost selections. Oy vey. This is definitely not Jack or a Jack equivalent. Taste wise it's harsh, with a nasty bite and a strange after taste even with Coke as a mixer. That being said, I think I can make this work if I pair it with some of my less expensive every day cigars. It's certainly not something I'd put alongside a Patel, Gurka, or Fuente, but I can see (taste?) it working with some of my value priced Thompson Cigar every day samplers. For the price I paid, it's about what I expected. It's not the worst I've ever had, but it most definitely isn't the same quality as a Jack Daniels and no one who purchases this should expect it to be. Since maybe isn't an option for the would you recommend this to a friend question I'm marking yes, but with the caveat that you don't expect a lot from it, use a mixer, and manage your expectations accordingly.",You Get What You Paid For

Lonehand Whiskey 750ml,Look it's not Jack it isn't Evan Williams but for a change I am enjoying it over ice. Total Wine's guy in the isle suggested it and It's fine. People bash everything. Smugglers is a good buy and tastes goo too but gets bashed.,This Is A Fine Change From Jack.
Lonehand Whiskey 750ml,"I didn’t expect much considering how cheap it was. But good lord it is awful. Tasted somewhat sweet and watered down. I can stomach ALOT of cheap stuff but this, blah!!! Don’t waste your money!!! Hands down the worst whiskey I’ve tasted.",Pure Garbage
Lonehand Whiskey 750ml,I tried this over ice first with no mixer and couldn't drink it due to sweetness. I hoped I could mix it with coke (diet coke actually) but that didn't work either. I can't take the taste and sweetness. So I sadly disposed of the rest of the bottle (which was most of it).,"Too Sweet, Not A Pleasant Taste"
Lonehand Whiskey 750ml,"Purchased this on recommendation of store clerk who stated it had ""positive reviews"". I would treat my lawnmower this badly!

Lonehand Whiskey 750ml,So there are a lot of bad reviews on this whiskey and I just don't understand it. Bought it at the recommendation of the asst. Manager and he couldn't have been more right. Even though price was definitely not a factor in my decision I couldn't be more happy. It easily bests $80+ bottles. Straight is fine but in a coke is amazing. I finished the bottle before I even opened my expensive selection. Buy with confidence!!,Amazing Whiskey
Lonehand Whiskey 750ml,Got two samples of this and have had it 1 other time since and each and every time I would have rather poured it out. The fact that total wine pushes this so much due to it being their own repackaged project ads insult to injury. Stick with partnering with good distilleries rather than pushing this trash without stating what it really is.,Honestly The Worst Whiskey I Have Ever Had.
Lonehand Whiskey 750ml,"Without question, this is the worst whiskey I have ever tasted. So disappointed in Total Wine for even carrying this crud. Even more disappointed in myself for dropping $30 on it. Do not make the same mistake I made ... pick any other bottle on the shelf and you will surely be much better off.",Lawn Mower Fuel
Lonehand Whiskey 750ml,It is not the buyer who made mistake. It is made by them and sold by them only to make a higher profit on bad product. It is a great value product just like walmart and they have it for every product in the store.,Discussion 3: Ethical Theory
Lonehand Whiskey 750ml,"EVERYONE: If you are looking for a cheaper version of Jack Daniels, THIS IS NOT IT! Lone Hand is not in the same realm as Jack Daniels. I would call Jack good, but not great. I would call Lone Hand bottom of the barrel trash. For only a few dollars more, you are far better off getting a bottle of Jack Daniels. But if you're going to buy any bourbon at that price point (yes, Jack Daniels is technically a bourbon whiskey), do yourself a favor and get a bottle of 1792 or Elijah Craig. You'll get a spectacular product for a similar price, instead of only saving 3 or 4 bucks and getting a bottle of garbage that you'll rather give away than finish yourself. And if you REALLY need to save the money, get a bottle of Ezra Brooks. It isn't the same exact flavor as Jack, (neither is Lone Hand) but if you're looking for cheap good whiskey (especially bourbon whiskey) you aren't going to find a better deal than Ezra Brooks.",Garbage Product Masquerading As Jack Daniels
Lonehand Whiskey 750ml,Bought a bottle and the smell was awful. I put it in a ginger ale and didn't even finish it. went right back to the store and was more satisfied with a Canadian Hunter.

Lonehand Whiskey 750ml,Tried this in store before I bought it and was very surprised with how smooth it was considering the reviews I’ve seen. It’s not overly complex but most Tennessee whiskeys aren’t imo. I get a little Carmel with no burn at all. Not comparable to my current favorite 4R SiB but for what I want it for (mixer) and late night sipper this guy is perfect. Can’t compare the two because the difference in proof and the fact that 4R is a “real” bourbon.,Better Than Advertised

Lonehand Whiskey 750ml,"I expected a certain sweet edge to this as it is a Tennessee whiskey, but the flavor borders on a liqueur. You mention that it is maple-filtered; the bottle makes it clear that the wood is sugar maple, which might well explain the taste. At its price I might consider it for a mixed drink, but not as a sippin' whiskey.","""Sweet""Heart Of The Rodeo?"
Lonehand Whiskey 750ml,"Wow...hard to imagine a worse whiskey experience. Had to give it one star in order to review, but it's a ""no star"" for me. Nose is heavy on solvent and mustiness. Color is pale...straw-like, rather than a deep brown. Absolutely no legs in the glass...watery in texture. Favor is faintly present...harsh, no mid-palate, finish is like water. If you want something that tastes like Jack Daniels, then buy Jack Daniels. The Lonehand is only slightly cheaper than Jack Daniels and not even remotely close in quality. Might be worth purchasing a bottle as a collectible as I expect that it will be off the market soon...at least in it's present packaging. The parent company of Jack Daniels is suing the Lonehand brand for trademark and ""trade dress"" violations. Note the bottle shape and label. The idea is to make you think you're buying Jack Daniels for a discount, but you're getting plonk.",Stunningly Poor
Lonehand Whiskey 750ml,"Compared to Jack Daniels by a store employee (but at a bargain price!). This is to Jack Daniels what a pogo stick is to a BMW. Avoid. I wouldn’t make whiskey sour with this stuff. Further, it inclines me to shoo away store employees trying to offer guidance on anything beverage related. If your buyer made a mistake, punish the buyer not the customers.",Swill
Lonehand Whiskey 750ml,"Admittedly, I was a bit skeptical when I saw the price, but they said it was better than Jack (not that that's too difficult), so I thought I'd try it. And I was not disappointed. While I usually prefer a bit more oak & spice in my whiskey, Lonehand certainly has far more complexity & depth than its one-dimensional older brother. Notes of sweet vanilla on the nose carry over to the palate, where a bouquet of rich caramel & fresh fruit joins the ensemble. The finish is quite smooth & long—the taste of honeycrisp apple lingered on my tongue for several minutes. As I hinted earlier, this would not be my first choice of whiskey (nor would it be my second), but I'm not sorry I bought it. If you're looking for a good, cheap Tennessee whiskey, I would suggest giving this a try, if nothing else. Who knows: you may find a new everyday go-to.",A Pleasant Surprise...
Lonehand Whiskey 750ml,"I bought a 750 of this on whim at the register to see if it was an adequate substitute for Jack Daniels. I should have gone with a couple of the airline-sized bottles instead and saved a few bucks. I've tried it neat, on the rocks, and chilled. It has been awful in every presentation. The initial wash across the tastebuds is unpleasant and the aftertaste is worse. I don't mix soda with any brown liquor, so I guess that some cola could cover up the nasty flavor and account for the positive reviews. The remainder is going down the drain. I'd be ashamed to even offer this at parties to people who don't know any better.",Awful

The price makes this a real bargain occasional change-of-pace whiskey.",Decent Whiskey - Great Price

McFarlane'S Reserve Kentucky Straight Bourbon 750ml,"What I love about this bourbon is between the soft mouthfeel, the gentle sweetness from the wheated mash bill, and the fact that it’s higher proof, it can stand up in a cocktail and carry its weight—it makes an excellent old fashioned—but it’s also delicious neat or on the rocks. I really like it in a Kentucky Mule, where those sweeter dark fruit and grain notes balance perfectly with the spicy kick of ginger beer.",Perfect For Any Occasion
McFarlane'S Reserve Kentucky Straight Bourbon 750ml,"Like many of the other reviewers, I was coaxed to try this bourbon as it compared favorably against Weller. I taste tested from a 750ml bottle and have to say it was a little hot but okay. The flavor was a bit thin, but I could pick up the vanilla and caramel, not too bad.  I decided to buy the 1.75l bottle. Bad idea. I should have bought the bottle I tasted. I opened my bottle last night after finishing a small batch bourbon. My first taste of the Mcfarlane was not only hot but weirdly tasted a bit like tequila. I wonder if the difference between what I originally tasted and this bottle is due to perhaps resetting the bottling line for 1.75L and using a different batch? I tried it again this afternoon, and no tequila flavor but definitely not comparable to Weller, nor the bottle I tasted in the store..... I think if this was given another 12 months of aging, it would possibly be a Weller contender, but we'll never know. My recommendation is to buy the smaller bottle for sure if you still want to try it.",There Are Better Bourbons For The Money

McFarlane'S Reserve Kentucky Straight Bourbon 750ml,"The opening nose was not huge, but it had a nice color from aging. The normal vanilla and fruit tastes that come with most bourbons wasn’t there. The lingering taste most bourbons have wasn’t there either. It’s taken me some time to process the taste. It reminds me of a very young bourbon with undeveloped sweetness and flavors mixed with a small amount of better taste to give some kind of color and nose. Even cheaper bar bourbons have some minor traces of vanilla and flavors this bourbon was void of them.

McFarlane'S Reserve Kentucky Straight Bourbon 750ml,I bought this while in Daytona Beach and was featured at the liquor store. Not good to drink neat or on the rocks. Might be good with soda,Okay Bourbon
McFarlane'S Reserve Kentucky Straight Bourbon 750ml,"We bought this whiskey after reading the pleasant-sounding description cards with the intent of putting it in cocktails. Alone, the whiskey has a harsh bite that almost tastes like some kind of industrial solvent. It lacks any smooth, caramel or vanilla notes that we were hoping to find. In cocktails, the whiskey overpowers good amaros and other additives, making mixing with it an exercise in mitigation of its unpleasant flavor.",Not A Great Whiskey
McFarlane'S Reserve Kentucky Straight Bourbon 750ml,Very smooth,Good Bourbon For The Price
McFarlane'S Reserve Kentucky Straight Bourbon 750ml,There are quite a few great bourbon but they are all getting pricey. MacFarlane s is quite good and affordable.,Good Bourbon For This Price Range

McFarlane'S Reserve Kentucky Straight Bourbon 750ml,"One of the best value, good bourbon I’ve tasted.",Excellent Affordable Bourbon
McFarlane'S Reserve Kentucky Straight Bourbon 750ml,"To start... it says it's a minimum of 3yo.! Which means it ""could have"" 4yo mixed in the batch ? But there is something about the finish, it was a hair too much cinnamon & the maker says it has a ""clean"" finish. It's more of a ethanol/medicinal ""clean"" finish. It really should be closer to the $15 to $17 range. Evan Williams white label is a minimum 4yo. (could have 5yo mixed in the batch), plus EW is a BIB, 100 proof ! The McFarlane is a wheater, & supposed to be sweeter than bourbon. But the EW 100 BIB, is a bourbon and it's smoother a touch sweeter and cheaper !!!","It'S Just Ok... Could Be Smoother, If It Was Older"
McFarlane'S Reserve Kentucky Straight Bourbon 750ml,"I hoped this would be a good fill-in for when Two Stars is not in stock, but it is a little more harsh (like it should be a economy purchase), but better than most. For a few dollars less, I'd keep a bottle around.","OK, But Could Be Smoother."

McFarlane'S Reserve Kentucky Straight Bourbon 750ml,For a bottle shelf wheat bourbon it’s pretty good has good taste and it’s great on mix drinks killed one bottle and it was delicious on old fashions with the bar smith mixer that u can find @ total wine as well,Impressive
McFarlane'S Reserve Kentucky Straight Bourbon 750ml,"This bourbon was a bit of a let down. The flavor profile is more Scotch (you get peat, and no barrel character) than bourbon, let alone a wheated bourbon. I would pass on this one and pick up Rebel Yell, Larceny Or Makers.",Let Down.

McFarlane'S Reserve Kentucky Straight Bourbon 750ml,"This was recommended to me, and it is very good!! Plus the price",Good Smooth Bourbon
McFarlane'S Reserve Kentucky Straight Bourbon 750ml,"Not nearly as smooth as I had hoped. Satisfactory in mixed drink but you can get a mixed drink bourbon for half this price. Current bourbon craze, especially in Kentucky, has distillers bottling anything and everything. There won't be a next time for McFarlane's Reserve at our house.",Disappointing
McFarlane'S Reserve Kentucky Straight Bourbon 750ml,Great flavor...very smooth,Great Buy...!!!!
McFarlane'S Reserve Kentucky Straight Bourbon 750ml,"It has the same flavor profile as Weller. A little more bite in the aftertaste due to a more oaky flavor and acidity, but still a good example of wheated bourbon. In Weller's absence from the Charleston market, it makes a good substitute.",A Little More Oaky Than WL Weller

McFarlane'S Reserve Kentucky Straight Bourbon 750ml,I will not purchase this again and will buy another Bulliet Rye,Bad After Taste
McFarlane'S Reserve Kentucky Straight Bourbon 750ml,"I wasn't expecting much from this when I got it, but it's not very often you find a wheated bourbon readily available other than Maker's. The 3 year age statement shows...and not in a good way in my opinion. The nose is fruity and scotch-like, showing the lack of aging and barrel influence. The pallet follows through with the fruity notes, which comes from the grains. Not much to speak of with the finish either. I have no use for this product. Will give it an extra star for being a wheated bourbon, but really does need some more age on it. This MIGHT be okay for transitioning a scotch drinker to bourbon, but you're flipping a coin on the response from that. There are better options readily available. I'd drink standard Maker's Mark over this every single day.","Young, Scotch-Like Bourbon"
McFarlane'S Reserve Kentucky Straight Bourbon 750ml,"Very smooth finish, not a heavy burn. Great for shots and mixers",Good Stuff

McFarlane'S Reserve Kentucky Straight Bourbon 750ml,"The kickback that Total Wine gets for advertising this as their Whiskey of the Month through the ""Spirits Direct"" program must be substantial because it's obvious that they didn't put any real effort into choosing a high quality, tasty bourbon.

Basil Hayden'S Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,"Did a 4 bourbon tasting and was shocked at how good this was. Smooth, could actually taste the complexity of the bourbon. The others were either just alcoholically raw or had chemical finishes. Saw one of the knocks against this is that proof which is one of the plusses. First, I don't drink to get hammered--its for the taste and a nice buzz. It's nice to have room in that buzz for a second glass which the high proof brands don't allow. Second its a great price point for something this complex and friendly.",The Best In A 4 Bourbon Tasting-

Basil Hayden'S Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,"This is a good one for those that are either new to bourbon drinking or just want a nice flavor regardless of the proof/price ratio. Because it is lower proof, it’s not a “value” buy....but it definitely is nice tasting and smooth. On the nose, it’s not very strong. Maybe a hint of sweetness and floral. But on the palate it is very noticeably caramel, and so very smooth. A smokey finish that lingers but wouldn’t call quite call it a long finish. I bought this with the intent of comparing to Four Roses Small Batch because they’re similar priced and I drink a lot of the 4R. After having tasted it, though, it’s apples and oranges comparison. I like both. I can see enjoying this one when not in the mood for a strong powerful bourbon. The lower proof, however, is a drawback.",Easy To Drink But Low Proof

Basil Hayden'S Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,Recently bought this bourbon unlike others doesn’t bite you or flow up your Nose bourbon is meant to be enjoyed not a contest of your ability to handle over strong liquor will buy again,Good Taste
Basil Hayden'S Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,"This is 2 1/2 stars at best. I tired it neat, with 1 ice cube and was not impressed finally I added a small amount of water to it with no ice and I felt like this was the best way to drink it. I won't be buying this again",Ehhhhh
Basil Hayden'S Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,The problem with Basil Hayden's for me is that it keeps me from trying other bourbons. Every time I reach for a nice looking $40 like Heaven's Door Tennessee Bourbon or heaven forbid a $50 bottle of something else I just can't do it. Basil Hayden's is so easy drinking (I drink it on the rocks) and so readily available and so inexpensive... my hand just changes direction.,I Keep Coming Back
Basil Hayden'S Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,"Received this as a holiday gift and I have heard many great things about it. I will start by saying that the Basil Hayden is a delicious bourbon; its not too oakey or too sweet but it just tastes like a classic well made bourbon. My only complaint is that it is a little thin on the palate. While the 40% ABV makes the Basil Hayden very smooth, it is definitely noticeably thin, especially off the heels of a 90-100 proof bourbon. On the bright side, while it may feel thinner in the mouth, it doesn't feel watery or muted in flavor. Overall a great bourbon and worthy of a 5/5, but at $40 a bottle, it's a little more than what I would want to pay for a daily drinking bourbon. If it were closer to $30, it would become my go-to recommendation for friends who were trying to get into whiskey/bourbon.",Great Bourbon!
Basil Hayden'S Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,"I don’t care if you’re drinking it neat, on the rocks, chasing, mixing, or taking shots. This is one of the best bourbons on the market. Great introductory bourbon to anyone who hasn’t had a good experience. Top 5 for bourbons under $40.",Can’T Go Wrong
Basil Hayden'S Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,This was my go to bourbon at my daughter's wedding. EXCELLENT!!,Very Smooth With A Nice Bourbon Finish. Not Earthy
Basil Hayden'S Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,By far the best bourbon I have tried.,Amazing Clean Bourbon
Basil Hayden'S Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,"A bit too simple in my opinion, its good but it lacks that flavor bomb I expect from a great bourbon, it is kind of like a mild down semi-sweet scotch, not my favorite.",It’S All Right
Basil Hayden'S Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,I’m not a nun. A sister had me try this and I very much liked it. Only burning candles. I will drink to date.,Bourbon For Nun Bourbon Drinkers
Basil Hayden'S Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,I found this Bourbon while browsing on Total Wines app. I decided to try it based on all the good reviews from other people and the good rating from TW. This is one of the smoothest Bourbons I have ever tasted. I am very happy that I decided to give it a try. I even sent a message to my brother and a good friend who are both whiskey and bourbon enthusiasts like I am. I told them I liked it and that they should try it. I was surprised to find out that they had both already tried it several times and they both like it too. If you are trying to decide what to purchase I don't think you will be disappointed with this one. I enjoy drinking my whiskey on the rocks just because I always like a cold drink. I think you will enjoy this either neat or on the rocks.,One Of The Smoothest Bourbons I Have Ever Tasted.

But this is the one I keep coming back to, especially for cocktails (Angel’s Envy is my favorite neat, but only by a very narrow margin). Maker’s Mark is so much rounder, smoother, and more mellow than most other bourbons I’ve tried.

Maker'S Mark Bourbon Whisky 1.75l,"Nose: There's some scorched oak dashing out when it's poured into the glass. A little alcoholic. After a few minutes, some sweet note like brown sugar starts to show. Then caramel.  Palate: Smooth and mellow, almost no bite. Very weak char in the front and it's soon gone. The oak is around all the time, making the palate quite woody, but not overwhelming. The body is light and tastes very sweet almost like licorice.  Finish: Still woody but no astringency at all. A little nutty in the beginning. There's malty sweetness lingers long, then turns into pear and apple zest. Cool and dry.  Comment: I believe this is one of the mellowest bourbons. But to my surprise, it's quite wood-focused, not just some plain sweet drink. The oak is nicely done, pleasantly running through the palate and lasting long in the finish. The nutty note in the finish is a little highlight to me, which could be attributed to the wheat and barley in their mash bill. The whole experience could be even better if that scorched oak on the nose is fixed.",Very Approachable

Well all bourbons are whiskeys.... BUT, not all whiskeys are bourbon. The mashbill or recipe is a little different than most bourbons. Makers Mark has no Rye. It has wheat in it, & it does smooth out any of the rough edges unlike some of the other bourbons in that 90 to 95 proof range. It has all the basics... ie. The vanilla, caramel, with a very small hint of cherry. Great neat room temp or keep it in the fridge & pour it neat. It's good with a mixer too.",Very Nice Wheat Bourbon For The Price

I'm a huge fan of Gentlemen Jack and I'll put Jameson right up there with it. However for me, the newest to me, Jameson IPA Edition is the smoothest whiskey I have ever had. For great whiskey, whisky, and bourbon, I don't like to do shots or mix it with anything. At the expense of great liquor, which I buy, why the mix or shots? That's a complete waste of great expensive whiskey/whisky. This IPA Edition is a sipping whiskey, no water, no ice...just sip.

For great whiskey, whisky, and bourbon, I don't like to do shots or mix it with anything. At the expense of great liquor, which I buy, why the mix or shots?

THIS ... is one dimensional and very disappointing. Many of the reviews addressed mixed drinks, and I don't do mixed drinks ... again ... my bad ... I should have read the reviews instead of viewing the overall rating. 93 points from Wine Enthusiast ??? In my opinion that rating is not a blind tasting ... that's a business deal.

However, they did not have it in stock, so I walked away with this bottle, as recommended by an employee of course. Just looked for the receipt to get the gentlemens name, but I guess I threw it out.

He told me that he actually preferred Bib and Tucker to Pappy. I don’t know if maybe it’s because I got the 6 year as opposed to the 10 year B&T, but I did not enjoy this bourbon at all. I’ve tried to drink it on 3 different occasions and at the forefront all I get is a strong hit of ethanol, some floral notes, but not much else. I personally did not like this and now I’m cautious about even purchasing the 10 year bottle. I’ll just stick to my Pappy and Weller.",Sits Collecting Dust

Bib & Tucker is smooth and finishes with a slight mild bite - very much like a single barrel bourbon. Perfect for sipping and preparing your pallet while grilling a good steak. I’m sure I’d feel guilty if I mixed it in a cocktail. It's just too good for that. Bib & Tucker is now my go to bourbon thanks to Total Wine & More.

Smooth, layered and with a sturdy bookish final note. A masculine bourbon is how i would classify it.

To describe this, it's somewhere between Bulleit Rye and Buffalo Trace, but it isnt as sweet as Makers Mark and has quite a bit of character and taste, I definitely found the taste of Vanilla and Caramel, lots of flavor, some heat and it finishes nice! This bottle didn't last long! Cant wait to get another!","Vanilla & Caramel, With Some Heat!"

Bib & Tucker 6 Year Bourbon 750ml,"Its got a nice swell of flavors at the beginning of caramel and vanilla but 2/3 if the way through it changes to a strange dirty rubber flavor and the finish is just bizarre, almost like burnt popcorn. Bottle looks cheap too and theres so much better in that price range like new riff single barrel.do not recommend.",Mediocre
Bib & Tucker 6 Year Bourbon 750ml,"The 92 proof whiskey in this bottle is a drinker with a dash of water. It brings a unique flavor heavy in nuts, licorice, and cinnamon. It finishes smooth many breaths later and has an enjoyable nose letting you know what you are about to get into. Bring this bottle out with friends, a couple of glasses, and a whiskey pitcher of water and you have an enjoyable whiskey drinking experience. From the attractive bottle with texture to the unique wedge cork you start your drinking experience before even taking a taste. Now the 92 proof bourbon in the bottle when opened up with a touch of water is very enjoyable with a moderate long finish. Is this a $50 whiskey in a bottle no, is this a $50 bottle of whiskey yes. Would I buy it again? Yes ...",Great Drinking Experience
Bib & Tucker 6 Year Bourbon 750ml,"Bib & Tucker, An oddity in bourbons for me. A bourbons to be reserved for a well trained pallet. This bourbon changes flavors on the finish.

Bib & Tucker 6 Year Bourbon 750ml,Bib and Tucker refers to your Sunday's best attire. Not only is the bottle elegant and charming but so is the liquid. Many bourbons are removing their age statement but Bib and Tucker is 6 years old. $50 is a decent value for a 6 year old. The Vanilla notes are great! I love this on the rocks but can also be served straight.,Best Dressed!
Bib & Tucker 6 Year Bourbon 750ml,"This is quite a unique bourbon. Its not that ""in your face"" every wood flavor in your mouth kind of bourbon. This is lighter and friendlier on the oak with hints of fruit, toasted cardamom, and a more delicate corn sweetness. This would be a 4 star if it wasn't for the fact that this is amazingly smooth.

Bib & Tucker 6 Year Bourbon 750ml,"A friend mentioned this to me, and it is not to disappoint. My favorites s are usually Wodford Reserve, Basil Hayden and Blanton's. This is up there with those. Super smooth and great flavor. Super glad it was recommended.",Great Bourbon!
Bib & Tucker 6 Year Bourbon 750ml,"Ok, It took me a while to review this whisky, because there are pro and con. let start with the Pros: taste profile is the best I ever experienced with a bourbon, but I don't know how much this count, because I am more a scotch drinker. However, I think this dram is very well balanced, more hazelnut/chestnuts taste profile than overly sweet vanilla and honey, that (for me) makes this bourbon not boring and overwhelming: translated, I can enjoy this bourbon everyday. The matter of the fact I am almost emptying my second bottle, and doesn't happen that easy with other bourbons. Now the Negative: I don't feel it is overly complex, it has a great beginning and a long, more than decent finish, but it is missing the mid range taste, in other words the experience is not that smooth from the beginning to the end, and it is a little harsh, getting better after few sips, but, you know, this happens almost with any other bottle LOL. Somebody in other review compared this to Maker marks, and that is true, very similar taste profile , but this is (in my opinion) not that sweet, so, more enjoyable. Now, the bottle is incredibly beautiful, and we probably overpay this drum. This spirit should be around 35 max. 40$ price point, no more, because the taste profile is great, but it still misses complexity. If this bottle was a 10 yo and single barrel, would be probably the best bourbon I ever had, but, again, the price is high for me for a 5-6 y/o. It is also true, however, that the taste profile is so appealing and easy that you are not getting bored, and you can keep enjoying it. So I would highly recommend to try it, and if you like the experience, and you have the money, well, you know what to do. .",Taste Profile GREAT.

Bib & Tucker 6 Year Bourbon 750ml,"This is a solid and complex bourbon best sipped neat. I would recommend this to anyone with an appreciation for good bourbon. Admittedly I passed on purchasing this several years ago. Its shelf appeal seemed a bit gimmicky, it did not appear to be from a grain to bottle distillery, and my complete lack of any prior information caused me to not chance it at a $45-50 price point. I was wrong, I had a chance to try it last year and was impressed, I’m now on my second bottle.

Side by side with a 90 proof sezerac rye, takes 5 drops h2o in the sez dram to get close to the smooth finish of this. Btw, leave the sez alone as well. Drink it neat, meaning no water.

Masterson'S Rye Whiskey 10 Year 750ml,"One of the finer things in life we get from the Canadians. If you drink rye, this has all the spices of the greener side of rye (rather than the spicy side): green apple, green apricot, kadota fig, grassy. Consistent throughout nose, palate, and finish, ie, what you smell is what you taste, and all there in the finish. Very smooth and rounded (expected at 90 proof though I like my rye barrel strength when I can get it). Mash bill is 100% rye. Got this for Xmas and it's 1/2 gone (2nd week of January). My only qualm is the price point which prevents me from giving it my 5 stars due to value (and prevents me from having it everyday.) Summary: I LOVE this rye - on the milder and greener side.

Maker'S Mark Bourbon Whisky 750ml,"Nose: There's some scorched oak dashing out when it's poured into the glass. A little alcoholic. After a few minutes, some sweet note like brown sugar starts to show. Then caramel.  Palate: Smooth and mellow, almost no bite. Very weak char in the front and it's soon gone. The oak is around all the time, making the palate quite woody, but not overwhelming. The body is light and tastes very sweet almost like licorice.  Finish: Still woody but no astringency at all. A little nutty in the beginning. There's malty sweetness lingers long, then turns into pear and apple zest. Cool and dry.  Comment: I believe this is one of the mellowest bourbons. But to my surprise, it's quite wood-focused, not just some plain sweet drink. The oak is nicely done, pleasantly running through the palate and lasting long in the finish. The nutty note in the finish is a little highlight to me, which could be attributed to the wheat and barley in their mash bill. The whole experience could be even better if that scorched oak on the nose is fixed.",Very Approachable

Well all bourbons are whiskeys.... BUT, not all whiskeys are bourbon. The mashbill or recipe is a little different than most bourbons. Makers Mark has no Rye. It has wheat in it, & it does smooth out any of the rough edges unlike some of the other bourbons in that 90 to 95 proof range. It has all the basics... ie. The vanilla, caramel, with a very small hint of cherry. Great neat room temp or keep it in the fridge & pour it neat. It's good with a mixer too.",Very Nice Wheat Bourbon For The Price

Black Eagle Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey 1.75l,"I had assumed that at this price point you would get a bourbon for mixing with cola or ginger ale. With all that sugar and carbonation even the best bourbons get lost. So I drank it neat at first and was surprised that I had a pretty good whiskey in the glass. Typical vanilla, caramel, and oak. But then came the finish with a little zing. It wasn't alcohol, so much as cinnamon. Or was it maple sugar? Definitely toasted something. Difficult to describe, but easy to like.

Black Eagle Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey 1.75l,"Black Eagle Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey is part of Total Wine’s “Direct Spirits®” line of products, so you will often hear it promoted in-store. As such, it’s readily available, affordably priced, and often discounted ever further when Total Wine is having a sale. Keeping those factors in mind, I’d rate it above average. I’ve tried it several times and other than an occasional after-taste, it’s palatable. What it lacks in smoothness and taste, is balanced by the affordability. If you’re looking for quantity over quality (large post-COVID gathering) this is a more than serviceable party bourbon and should be ideal, especially as a mixer.

Slightly sweet but not much depth.  Finish: Slight astringent but the sweetness somehow makes a little final statement before everything goes away. Short and dry.  Comment: This is a bland and simple bourbon without much to discover. I believe this is what is called a mixer. But this mixer is actually pretty balanced and doesn't have much unpleasant flavor except for the pungent ethanol nose. With this price I think it deserves 4 stars.",A Good Mixer Even By Itself

Black Eagle Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey 1.75l,,Great Taste
Black Eagle Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey 1.75l,"This is a serviceable party bourbon, relatively heavy in body and a bit lacking in smoothness but standard in flavor. What distracts me the most about this particular bourbon is that for some reason, it has the weird tendency to leave a syrupy film at the back of your throat that is most apparent when sipped neat (which is my preference). It becomes distracting the more you drink, and results in a stale taste in your mouth long after you've finished drinking for the night. For the money, I would recommend other Bourbons such as Ezra Brooks, which are cheaper and better flavored, but don't have the funky after-taste.","While Not Bad, There Are Better Options Out There"

Black Eagle Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey 1.75l,"I got a couple of the small sample bottle and tried this last night. All I can say is that it is one of the worst tasting and bitter bourbons I've had. At first on the tongue it's not very flavorful and has a flatness to it. Then going down it has a heavy burn and leaves a bitterness in the mouth that seems to get more bitter and foul tasting the more you consume. This is just MY opinion and I know that there are those that really like this stuff. I drink Jim Beam Devils Cut, Redemption, Black Velvet 8 and this black eagle just doesn't even come close to the enjoyment I get from the others. You may or may not like it.

It's so thin, sugary sweet, burns going down and it's the first time in over 30 years of drinking bourbon where I had to think what I could COOK with this bottle because it's undrinkable but probably good for cooking and baking.

Evan Williams 1.75l,"I class bourbons as mixers or sippers. Sippers have distinctive flavors that mark the bourbon as unique and preferable, and that may often clash if you mix them with other flavors like bitters or fruits. Woodford Reserve or Jack Daniels for instance. Mixers are smooth, maybe a bit edgy, but overall not too distinctive. Makers Mark is one of the best mixers, but it's pricey. Evan Williams is nearly as good for about half the cost. And, in some ways, it's better. It's got a roughness to it that would be a black mark in a scotch but has a certain charm in a bourbon. Try a Makers Mark and a Evan Williams Manhattan or old fashioned. Both good, but very different.",Best Mixer Bourbon At This Price Point

Evan Williams 1.75l,I got a sample bottle to give it a try. Never had it before and thought i'd try it as I've herd others remark on it and read some of the reviews. It's good and smooth. A friendly aroma and a kind of caramel start to an oaky and smokey finish with a mild warm throat. Leaves a nice tingle on the lips too. It's not one of my favorites but it is a drink that is easy to consume and not have your throat burn up. Goes down easy and warm. A good bourbon for the price.,Good Stuff

It's sweet, but not so much as to be cloying. Perfect evening relaxation drink. I hear it's good in cocktails too, but I wouldn't know. Straight up, or with a little water (Bourbon and Water), it's plenty good. It's so cheap, and so tasty. You can't go wrong for this price. This is quality at its most accessible.

The price was much lower than Jack Daniel's Black Label that had been my go-to whiskey since I began enjoying the same spirit favored by my dad and grandpa. Evan Williams is also an 86 proof product, and that also sets it apart from the ordinary whiskies generally available. Evan Williams features a smooth taste, and it mixes well with club soda.

Evan Williams 1.75l,"Bourbons have come and gone in my household. Cheap bourbons, expensive bourbons, great bourbons, mediocre bourbons, astringent bourbons, sweet bourbons. And I come back to this one every time. It's the classic. Ol' E. Bill is a trustworthy friend who has never let me down yet. Sure, there are more complex drams out there. There are limited editions, barrel-proofs, wheaters, etc. But this friend of mine has a gentle, sweet embrace (slightly smoky and nutty as well) which makes me feel safe in his arms. For something like $13 you're getting whiskey most of which is from 5-7 year old barrels. That's a steal. Though even without the cost factored in, I still think it's better than most mid-to-bottom-shelf bottles I've tried. Including its older brother, the White in Bond. Maybe not better than a certain 101-proof fowl, but that one costs twice as much and definitely isn't twice as good. See the dilemma? Evan is a staple. Heaven Hill needs to leave him the h*ll alone because he's great just the way he is. At least until I croak; then I won't care.",House Bourbon

Evan Williams 1.75l,"Super cheap price for its worth (good thing). I really really like this bourbon, and it is easy to forget youre drinking liqour. No need to mix it in anything, it's already as sweet as it is...drink it with french toast in the mornings and you wont need maple syrup. The bourbon is sweeter (in my opinion) than jack daniels but also easier to drink. As in, you (in my opinion) could very easily get carried away and end up drinking 10 oz within 2 hours and then you realise what great thing you've done. I do not enjoy sweet drinks, although I love honey, and this is my one acception. I recommend it for anyone who wants a sweet treat to relax to/with on a warm or cold night/day. Its also affordable and not expensive, so If you do not enjoy it, mix it with something (maybe unsweet tea). You can't really lose here.",Honey Comb
Evan Williams 1.75l,"First of all, face it, this is cheap whisky! Better than other cheap whiskies, most of them $5 more for a 1.75. It is dark and strong flavored without being harsh, and a full 86 proof - definitely not watered down. I like the amount of rye flavor, not too sweet, with a good sour mash backbone. Best of all, for me, it stands up well to a beer chaser, so if you like a boilermaker this will be worth trying.","Has Been Referred To As ""The Prince Of Paupers"""

Four Roses is excellent and I will compare it to Evan Williams soon, but I just finished a comparison with Jim Beam white label and this is superior, to my taste.

Otherwise, for $7 less per bottle, it's certainly worth it.","Good, But Prefer The Bottled-In-Bond Version."
Evan Williams 1.75l,"Objectively, 4 stars. Price factored in, 5 stars. $16.00 for 1.75 liters of delicious 86 proof whiskey is all that need be said. Yes, I like the white label BOB better. Yes, 7-8-year-old Wild Turkey 101 is another great everyday value. But with the ridiculously good taste to value ratio with Evan Williams black, this is hands-down the best buy in Bourbon. Having a handle or two of this in the house at all times, lets me branch out and spend money on much more upscale libations.

My favorite bourbon is Blanton's single barrel and I am also a big fan of Knob Creek 100pf and Wild Turkey 101, but this stuff is too good to not always have in stock. If you are new to bourbon or American whiskey, seriously pick this up before you get Jim Beam or Jack Daniels. EW is much more complex and smooth. Pick up the 1.75 L bottle, it's an even better deal than the standard bottle. P.S. If you like EW Black, definitely check out EW Bottled in Bond and EW Single Barrel.

Evan Williams 1.75l,"As a former bartender I have developed a wide ranging taste for liquor; mixed drinks yes, but mostly straight over ice. I have been enjoying whiskey for 30 yrs and Crown Royal is my standby. I also love bourbon on the rocks but Basil Hayden and Woodford are too expensive to drink on a regular basis. For my taste, I have long enjoyed Evan Williams as an 'everyday' bourbon and find it better than at least six others I have tried that cost twice as much. For an occasional changeup I will mix 2/3 Evan with 1/3 Black Eagle honey bourbon. If you enjoy a little honey twist try it out.",Well Worth The Price.

Have tried many other bourbons in the under $20 range,but i always come back to this one as my standby. Has an average nose,palate and finish that typifies a classic bourbon profile. I drink it neat only but think it has enough body that it would hold up quite well in a cocktail. 5 stars is for the quality/$ ratio.",Best Budget Bourbon
Evan Williams 1.75l,In general with whiskey (unlike vodka) you get what you pay for. Here you get a little more than what you pay for. As should be no surprise to anyone Evan Williams is a great value. It doesn't taste great but it doesn't taste terrible either.

Evan Williams 1.75l,"Upon first opening the bottle, the aroma was that of a venerable old whiskey of good character. I was most delighted. Then, upon pouring the whiskey into a glass the aroma degenerated into odors of acetone, wall paint, varnish, and similarly unpleasant tasting substances.

A perfect pour over ice or into icy branch water, maybe the black label will trick Tennessee whiskey drinkers into heading north across state lines to a better bottle for less money.

Evan Williams 1.75l,"This bourbon is ridiculous. It is rich, complex, spicy, and thoroughly delightful. It stands on its own as a great sipping whiskey, but really shines in a Manhattan since it is less sweet than many bourbons. I just don't understand why it is so amazing for this price. It isn't Woodford Reserve (nothing else is) but I think many people unfairly judge it by it's price. Pretend you paid $40 for the bottle and you'll be amazed.",How Can It Be This Good For This Price?

Evan Williams 1.75l,"While it is pretty drinkable neat I'd probably relegate this as a mixer. Alcohol is pretty harsh and it lacks a richer complexity that would pull this whiskey together. And even as a mixer it tends to get lost but I find that to be the case with most whiskies that are considered mixers. Given the price point and the drinkability it's worth having in your bar .

This is not Bullitt. It’s lighter, but very tasty and actually smooth when neat. I’ve been enjoying it, while my wife, who does not drink, prepares dinner, while we discuss the day.

Riverboat Rye Whiskey 750ml,"Undeveloped, flavor is not really that great and just basically tastes like...well...alcohol.",Mix This In Something
Riverboat Rye Whiskey 750ml,"I've been intrigued by this whiskey for a while due to its ""unfiltered"" statement. I think it's great that whiskey's are not filtered or ""non-chilled filtered"" as it provides more flavor enhancing compounds which filtration removes. At 40%, it doesn't need water. Drinking neat is fine but I found myself trying to smell something special, but not really finding it. This whiskey has lots of potential. Since it's aged for just about a year or so, it's very young and not fully developed. The redemption Rye is supposedly the same whiskey but aged longer. I haven't had a chance to taste it, but I can only assume it's got what Riverboat is missing. To the tasting, I got lots of spice and specially cloves. If you're a Vitus beer fan, I was reminded of the after taste I get with that beer. Also, if you've tried the High Point Rendezvous Rye you'll notice the same minty finish. The finish is flavorful but quick and leaves me reaching for a satisfaction that's never reached. Although I don't reach that satisfaction, for $22 you can't really be picky as this gets extra points for affordability having such a unique taste. Riverboat Rye is definitely different than your $22 whiskey and should be stocked at all times given this price.",Not Bad For A Youngin

I have other bottles with more complex tastes but who wants to run through $100 bottles like it’s water?,Worth Experimenting With.
Carlyle Blended Scotch Whisky 1.75l,"Not overly complex, but there are some nice flavors here. Bringing the glass to your nose, you're met with baked apples and lemon peel. Upon sipping, there is a flood of caramel sauce, giving way to something a little bitter, like a strong tea. Aftertaste is smoky, even a little charcoal-y. This is not a super smooth, complex dram to linger over. It does have more character than most entry level blends. If you can get it on sale, I think it represents a good deal.",Great Deal At Sale Price

Carlyle Blended Scotch Whisky 1.75l,"This is one of the best things I discovered. I have found this whisky to have the typical oak and honey scent from a speyside scotch with a hint of warm wheat bread, the kind fresh from the oven. It does have a slight burn—not bite—in the beginning, but it goes away quickly. This is a good scotch to help introduce newcomers to scotch whisky. It’s also very affordable so you can have one of these sitting at home as a dram and for others to make cocktails with, because nobody is touching my Aberfeldy 21 for that. For anyone that did not like this, give it another chance and really sit with it. Add a few drops of water in your glass to bring out more of the bread notes.",Excellent Budget Scotch

Seagram'S 7 1.75l,"If you like the taste of Canadian whisky but prefer to buy American, this is a good option. It has a very similar flavor profile to Canadian blends, with thick caramel, vanilla, and nutty qualities supplemented by some fruit flavors (to me it tastes like apricot). This makes a pretty good whiskey sour due to its semblance to the Canadian stuff (I used to prefer Texas Crown or Crown Royal for my sours). Really good bargain for the 1.75L at Total Wine. Also tastes good on the rocks. Excellent option for an evening with friends.",Good Substitute For Canadian Whisky

Skatterbrain Peanut Butter Whiskey 50ml,This is very good has a more roasted peanut taste,Not Too Sweet
Skatterbrain Peanut Butter Whiskey 50ml,"Pay close attention. Scatterbrain is not a bad whiskey as far as flavored whiskies go. However, I believe it to be mislabeled. It has strong aromas and flavors of butterscotch and vanilla, NOT peanut butter. The combination of vanilla, butterscotch, and caramel do not equate to a peanut butter taste. Screwball has an intense flavor of pure peanut butter, almost equivalent to a mouthful of store bought peanut butter. Scatterbrain does not. However, all that being said, Scatterbrain is not a poor choice; if you’re someone that enjoys the taste of butterscotch then you have found the elite whiskey for you. Though, if you’re looking for that authentic peanut butter taste, then this is not the ideal purchase. For that, you’ll want Screwball. Therefore, this is a mislabeled product.",Scatterbrain Vs.

Some have been pleasant surprises and actually tasted better than more expensive bourbons. This one was an exception. It smells great on the nose. There is not much flavor on the palate and the finish resembled turpentine. It was rather disappointing. This appears to be a product of one of the mega-companies with no known source. This is NOT a Tennessee whiskey and is a disgrace to using the term. There are much cheaper bourbons on the shelf that are much better including Very Old Barton or even Old Fitzgerald.

Lonehand fits the bill nicely for mixing - its inexpensive, has a decent flavor (although a little sweet for sipping), and it mixes well.",A Little Sweet

Lonehand Whiskey 50ml,I was a bit pleased to see that this one is a nice drink. Great aroma hints of caramel and vanilla with a tad bit of smoke. Filtered through sugar maple charcoal it comes off with just a wee bit of sweetness upfront. Let it linger on the tongue and you'll get the warmth and spice of cinnamon. Tickles the tongue and lips and has a nice even warmth finish. A smooth drink with not a lot of heat or bitterness. It's not up there in my top ten but is is a good drink that I would not refuse if offered.

Two things I should’ve noticed before I bought. First, age statement is “at least one year”. Second it’s only 80 proof. Nose is strong yeast. Taste was yeasty and thin.

Lonehand Whiskey 50ml,"This whiskey's taste seemed watery, lacking depth or complexity, and generally very underwhelming to me; not sure if it's the bottle I got, a problem with the batch, or something else. What made it worse was it had a artificial 'maple syrup' flavor present that, while faint, was still enough to be distracting even when mixed. Coupled together, these factors made it a grueling and unpleasant slog through the rest of the bottle (and we still ended up abandoning about 1/10 of it at the bottom anyway). Though I got it on sale in-store ($25) and on recommendation from a store representative, I just can't get past the taste. I would much rather buy Ezra Brooks, which is $10 cheaper and whose flavor is twice as good.","Weird Flavor, Poor Value"

Jim Beam Black Extra Aged Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,"I purchased this Bourbon based off all of the great reviews. I have to say I am disappointed.

Jim Beam Black Extra Aged Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,"It just didn't do it for me. Even though skeptical of the ""World's Highest Rated"" on the label, I gave it a fair shake I think- 3 attempts over a long period of time- I have a pretty sizable collection anyway. It may be the best Jim Beam, and it isn't bad, it just isn't great and I wonder how in the world it got a 98 rating? It tastes like a Bourbon, but it's a bit thin after the initial spice/pepper. The vanilla was not as pronounced though there was a bit of a nougat-type flavor that comes through in some brands. Finish was ok, between smooth and tobacco-ish? It's fine, it's ok, but definitely unremarkable. Priced well enough for mixing, on par with Evan Williams or Old Forester. Sorry JB fans...",I Didn'T Get It.

Jim Beam Black Extra Aged Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,"Just to clarify - this review is for the Extra Aged, No Aged Statement (NAS) version, NOT the original Double Aged, 8 Year Old bourbon. The Jim Beam distillery recently did away with the latter bourbon for reasons unknown (most likely to push their products out on the market quicker to meet ever-increasing demand). The nose for this bourbon is ostensibly classic Jim Beam, radiating gentle waves of vanilla and caramel with faint spices trailing not far behind. Although the body of this spirit is somewhat flat, it nonetheless harbors supple flavor notes of vanilla, toffee, black pepper, and sweet corn. The finish is smooth and slightly spicy, with a very minimal burn that's characteristic of an 86-proof bourbon. Although I would've liked to do a side-by-side comparison with this Extra Aged bourbon with the former Double Aged expression, it nevertheless satisfies as a cheaper alternative to premier brands such as Maker's Mark and Buffalo Trace. Suffice to say, Jim Beam Extra Aged won't bedazzle anyone, nor will it disappoint, as a solid sipping and mixing bourbon.","Replacement Of The Classic ""Double Aged"" Expression"
Jim Beam Black Extra Aged Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,"After trying much more expensive bourbons like Angles Envy, Eagle Rare 10, Blanton's, Wild Turkey Spirit and others, my brother told me JB Black was his favorite.

Jim Beam Black Extra Aged Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,"Excellent taste, flavor, and aroma. Goes best with Coke.","Best Value For The Money, Hands Down!"
Jim Beam Black Extra Aged Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,"Not really 100% on JB Black. This isn't to say that it's a bad bourbon by any means. It's pretty good, in fact. I may have to purchase another bottle, just to give it a fair shot. I really don't have anything bad to say about it, but nothing overly amazing to say, either. Still, I would recommend this to people who like a little more oak in their bourbon. The charred oak comes through a little more, and it's slightly dry. Again, understand that I have no real complaints with this, it's just not something that really stands out to me.","Good, But Not Great"
Jim Beam Black Extra Aged Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,"This is a very good bourbon, quite smooth, with a nice aroma, deep rich color denoting the proper aging. However, in a recent taste testing (neat of course) it didn't fair as well as Buffalo Trace, or Old Forrester, by a comfortable margin. JBB was on par with Bullet and Makers Mark. It's certinaly better than regular Jim Beam or JD, it's a solid bourbon, with few excuses. But I'd pick OF or BT over it.",Very Good Bourbon
Jim Beam Black Extra Aged Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,"I was at a Beam event not more than 2 years ago with all of the Beam products available for tasting. Inevitably someone asked Beam's Master Distiller if he was on a deserted island and could take just one with him, which one would he take with him? Without hesitation he responded ""Black."" Black is smooth and complex. if you like a bourbon before bed or after dinner, this is it. I prefer all my bourbons neat but just a touch of water can open this one up nicely. I still drink Jim Beam White neat or with a cube, but the difference between 4 years and 8 years in a barrel is a very smooth, excellent, and a more polished bourbon. I don't really care the proof, a good bourbon is a good bourbon. Beam's small batch Knob Creek is just fine, but does not touch Black. I prefer it to Maker's Mark & Jack Daniels too.",An Excellent American Whiskey/ Bourbon And A Great Value

Kavanagh Irish Whiskey 750ml,"I bought this after the local store ran out of Red Bush, and it wasn't bad. I use Irish Whiskey's for a smooth mixed drink experience and this one fits the bill nicely. It is definitely better than Jamison, lacking the bitter aftertaste of that popular brand, and the price is right. Also, I prefer the bourbon-casks over the sherry one's. My wife and I are very casual drinkers so I am sure we haven't developed a taste for more adventurous bottles. Too me this is a great starter whiskey.","Smooth, Mellow"
Kavanagh Irish Whiskey 750ml,"Over the past couple of months, I've been trying new Irish whiskeys. I bought this one, in part, because of the reviews, but mainly because of the decent price. For me, Kavanagh Irish whiskey is thin and weak, and it is a solid zero in character. There just isn't any real... flavor. Now, some have applauded it for being ""smooth"". That's cool too. I've had, and enjoyed, very smooth whiskies that have character. This is different. If I were forced to use one single word to describe Kavanagh, that word would be ""meh"". Perhaps, as others have mentioned, Kavanagh is best suited for those new to the experience of whiskey, and that isn't to say that's a bad thing. We all started somewhere, and I'm betting it wasn't with Kilbeggan 18. For some, this may be excellent whiskey at a great price. Personally, I want more character and flavor, and for not that much more money, it's out there.",A Bit On The Timid Side For My Taste
Kavanagh Irish Whiskey 750ml,"I followed the recommendation of the store associate. I was looking for a reasonable Irish Whiskey at a reasonable price. She recommended this Kavanagh product.

Kavanagh Irish Whiskey 750ml,This whiskey isn’t horrible but it isn’t good either. I’m a bourbon drinker but I got this for St Patty’s day and decided to try it a few days early. I wouldn’t buy this one again. It’s a very light bodied whiskey with little flavor but what’s there is a caramel flavor that reminds me of a Canadian whiskey that I didn’t care for either.

Kavanagh Irish Whiskey 750ml,"I may be a traitor but the sour, peaty taste of much Scotch, including the single malts, doesn't appeal to me. The sweeter, smoother Irish blends are more likely to loosen my tongue to spout inspired blarney and be a good friend to all. The Kavanagh is no exception, and I rate the 1.75 liter a BEST BUY - good neat or as a mixer, only 80 Proof but you won't find better for the price.","I'M SCOTTISH, BUT PREFER IRISH WHISKY"

Kavanagh Irish Whiskey 750ml,Jameson is my go to. I was at store and thought would change it up and try something different. Not bad pretty sweet at first unlike most Irish whiskeys then mellows out.

Kavanagh Irish Whiskey 750ml,"Saw the great price on this and decided to pass on my usual Jameson in favor of this. It's not the worst whiskey that I have tried but it is not very good either. Didn't really taste like an Irish at all to me, and fell way short of being as good as the regular Irish stuff like Jameson or Bushmill.",Stick With Your Regular Irish
Kavanagh Irish Whiskey 750ml,"This is an amazing Irish whiskey, it's smooth, and delicious. Drinking it straight is alright, but mixing it with some Dr.Pepper really makes the flavor pop.

Kavanagh Irish Whiskey 750ml,"I was told that this doesn't have the ""bite"" that traditional Irish whiskey has and I believe it. I like it far better. I love scotch, but find most Irish whiskey to harsh but with good flavor. This whiskey has a soft caramel nose to it.. it tastes of caramel, vanilla, and almost like cream? Also has almost a sweet quality to it. I think this would make an a perfect after sinner Whiskey do to its aroma and taste having the almost desert like flavors to it. This is not like the traditional Irish Whiskeys out there. If you want tranditional keep looking... but this is smooth and flavorful.","Good If You Don'T Like Whiskey With A ""Bite "" And Love Camel Notes"

For a smooth, great flavored, easy to sip whiskey, this is a go-to. No it doesn't have the taste of scotch (it's not supposed to) so don't expect that. Little bit sweet and a nice after taste (finish?). If you like good whiskies, try this.",Very Good Irish Whiskey

When I had Kavanagh the first time, I thought it was very good... skeptical I tried it again, and shared it with others. Same reaction; very good.

To the point, Tin Cup has a very approachable flavor profile.

I was pleasantly surprised. This is a Ginger Whiskey that can be sipped straight up, unlike the cloying taste of many other flavored spirits.

At 92 proof and with a 95% rye mashbill, this has bite and kick and that delicious sweet peppery spicy rye flavor.

My last experiences with rye whiskeys years ago were far from pleasant and I've avoided them since. But Redemption as its name suggests has some great qualities. It has a light, almost sweet taste without any burn. A nice change from my usual happy hour libations which I will certainly continue to enjoy.",Pleasant Surprise
Redemption Rye 750ml,Was looking for an interesting mid-priced rye. Store employee suggested this one. I find it bland. No distinctive flavor. It is fairly smooth but nothing memorable about the taste. Could probably get something as good for 2/3 the price,There Are Better Options

Redemption Rye 750ml,"Just finally bought my first bottle last night. Was excited to get it home and make a Manhattan. I love Rye, straight, rocks, mixed, you name it. I have many Rye's in my case so one at $30 seemed like a good deal. first sip straight was surprisingly very good, sweet, not hot, very mellow for Rye almost too mellow, I was expecting more I guess and yet was not disappointed? However, as soon as the profile started...it vanished. No lingering on the tongue, just seemed to evaporate. So I made my drinks, and can say it makes a great Manhattan, I will pick one of my others for drinking neat. I would advise people who are not familiar to Rye to try this one, it is easy to drink, and has a nice start with an ending that is not disappointing but rather short, with no burn.",Nice Flavor-No Stamina
Redemption Rye 750ml,"While I really love a nice bourbon, I also like a nice rye whiskey at times. I say, why go for a barely legal 51% rye when you can get a 95% rye? This one sourced from MGP and aged in new charred oak barrels. On the nose I get a slight herb note, to me it is a bit like dill but in a really good way. On the taste I get a really well-balanced rye. I bought two bottles, about a year apart, and have settled on this one as my ""go to"" rye, and the price is reasonable too.",A Really Nice 95% Rye.

Redemption Rye 750ml,"I was surprised to see the really bad reviews here. I found this to be a solid, decently smooth rye whiskey, with a little sweetness that I liked. It's a tad hot for my taste (92 proof) but decently well-balanced. Think the 'chemical' folks just had a bad batch",Solid Whiskey

I typically drink Scotch, but wanted to venture out, and very glad I did, this is very different from Scotch and Bourbon, and I really like it! I drank it neat, no ice, no water, straight up...and this whiskey is really smooth with mellow burn and great flavor. Not complex flavors that I am used to with Scotches I drink, but a really good and drinkable whiskey...and at this price a great option to consider...recommend!",Pretty Dang Good

Redemption Rye 750ml,"What more can you ask for? This is a decent rye whiskey. This isn't a six year Willett or a 7 year sourced Smooth Ambler, but I think you would be hard pressed to get that good rye spice out of some of those other comparably priced ryes in this price range. I drink it neat, on ice or in cocktails. Just my two cents. Cheers and thanks TotalWine!","High Rye Mashbill, Great State Of Indiana.."

Redemption Rye 750ml,"This was the worst tasting boubon I've ever tried. It was so nasty (tasted like bad chemicals were added to cheap whisky) that my friend and I after 3 sips concluded that it was ""undrinkable"" and dumped the entire bottle down the drain-something that in all my years have never done. Don't waste you money on this low-cost swill.",Undrinkable

Redemption Rye 750ml,"Redemption Rye has a decent flavor, but is a little bitter when compared to higher end rye's. At the same time, it is head and shoulders above most of the other ""bargin"" priced rye's on the shelf. If you are new to rye, I would recommend you start with a higher end rye simply because rye already has more spice and bite than bourbon and to those unfamiliar with this flavor profile it can take a bit of getting used to. Redemption rye lacks some of the richness and depth of high end rye, but is decent for the price you pay.",Not Bad For The Price...
Redemption Rye 750ml,Excellent whiskey for the price. A staple in my cabinet.,Very Smooth With Ice
Redemption Rye 750ml,"I was searching for a cheaper, yet still subtle, substitute for the big name bourbons - something inexpensive and still smooth.

Easy to drink from neat to mixed, all bourbon drinkers have it available all the time. If you dare, have your friends over for a blind tasting with other bourbons. No one will give you the Jim Beam back. Oh don't misunderstand, other bourbons are better in many ways, but most bourbon drinkers I have known over the past 55 years prefer Jim Beam to relax with after a tough day on the job.",Jim Beam Is The Standard

It’s as good as stuff more expensive stuff but so are some other bourbons. Beam is consistent, smooth and tastes like a classic bourbon. Never understood why one would pay more for Jack Daniels when beam is less. Great for mixed drinks, good on the rocks and even decent served neat.

Jim Beam Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,"Jim Beam doesn't belong on the bottom shelf. I've been searching for another bourbon that has the Beam taste, but I just can't find it. 25$ for a 1.75 liter is such a good value.",Amazing Alcohol.
Jim Beam Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,Not top-shelf and certainly not bottom-shelf. Excellent both straight and mixed. Very balanced flavor with just the right amount of bite.,Nice Mid-Range Bourbon
Jim Beam Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,"...though it's not actually a secret - Jim Beam and Old Crow are made from the same mash bill by the same distillers. Old Crow Reserve and Jim Beam white are usually the same price for a 1.75L and are both aged four years, but Old Crow Reserve is bottled at a higher proof (86 proof). Both are very good whiskies, but I'll take the Old Crow at 86 proof over the 80 proof Jim Beam. Plus, Old Crow has a cooler name because it conjures up mental images of a rotgut whiskey (hah).",I'M Going To Let You In On A Little Secret...

Jim Beam Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,"As far as value, you're probably not going to get much better than Jim Beam. I haven't tried a single product by them I wouldn't buy again, and this obviously extends to their white label bourbon. Surprisingly rich and abundant for such a cheap bottle, this offers enough warmth and satisfaction for just about any bourbon drinker. No, it's not prime, top-shelf quality, but it's definitely about as well-rounded and accessible as you're going to get. For the price, it's a masterpiece. Compared to other, more expensive brands, it's still solid (and even superior).",Easy To Recommend

An open bar at an event offered JB or Jack, so I ordered Jim Beam and really enjoyed it with a nice plate of cheese and bread. I think this is going to become a staple in my home bar now... space is limited, so I will finish one of those existing bottles before I have room...

However, the standard Jim Beam white label bourbon is an incredibly easy spirit to recommend for a host of reasons. The price is unbeatable, especially considering how well it holds up as a sipper and mixer. First time I tried Jim Beam, I got a curiously nutty taste, but a smooth one.

Winchester KY Double Oak Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,"Gonna be honest, I bought this when it first came out, and didn't really have high hopes for this one mainly because of the reviews and experiences for Winchester's Straight Bourbon and Kentucky Bourbon.

Nose: Dried Fruit, Vanilla, Some Citrus, Malt Palate: Dried Fruit, Caramel, BIG hits of Sherry Finish: Oak, Caramel, Sweet Not that complex, but a MUCH better buy than you would get with the other Winchester line.

Black Velvet 1.75l,My favorite Canadian whisky I have tried. Tried Crown Royal and was very bored by it. Black velvet is excellent for what it is.,Amazing Mixer!
Black Velvet 1.75l,"There's a reason this stuff flies off the shelves at my local Total Wine store. And that would be the fact that it's cheap. Nevertheless, this is the first Canadian whiskey that I ever tasted, and it's still what I prefer. IMO, this is what Canadian whiskey should taste like. And I likes it straight up, without colas or mixers. The 8yo BV is even smoother, but for the difference in price, this is THE ONE.",The UnCROWNed King Of Canadian Whiskeys
Black Velvet 1.75l,Bought some years ago when I couldn’t afford one of the big names and I really liked it. Years later I can now afford whatever I want and I still choose Black Velvet. The price remains attractive but the flavor keeps me.,Won’T Switch
Black Velvet 1.75l,"Excellent, smooth Canadian whiskey at a reasonable price.",Black Velvet
Black Velvet 1.75l,I like Black Velvet with a mixer (coke/sprite) and as a sipping drink with a chaser. Smooth finish and consistent flavor makes it a no brainer.,Great Value Blend
Black Velvet 1.75l,"At this price point there are other Canadian whiskies, however they are not drinkable in my opinion. Black Velvet is no Canadian Club, but it is decent straight up and a great value. Good for folks like me who are on a budget but don't want to compromise quality, much.",Not Too Shabby!
Black Velvet 1.75l,One of the least expensive Canadian whiskies. The flavor is smooth with no objectionable notes. Works well with mixers. A bit too bland to drink straight. A great deal for parties because of its unobtrusiveness and low price make it easy to share and enjoy.,A Great Basic Canadian Whisky
Black Velvet 1.75l,"A Highball is my go-to quick cocktail: easy to make, goes down easy and is always refreshing. A classic Highball consists of Canadian Whisky and Canada Dry ginger ale. For that purpose, I keep my price per handle (1.75L) under $14 (on occasion I will go $16 for a handle of Seagram's VO, which can be sipped in a pinch). In a blind test, I would have a difficult time choosing between Canadian Club, Canadian Mist, Windsor, and this, Rich & Rare. Black Velvet used to be my go-to due to easy availability and low price. But, it is a bit bitey (new word) compared to those mentioned above. Although the 8-year BV is good and sip-worthy, too, it is not value priced. I only sip (over rocks) Crown Royal (or the Kirkland facsimile). To conclude, I have three categories: good for a Highball, crossover - excellent for Highballs/sip in a pinch, and Whisky on the rocks (like Scotch). Given the aforementioned alternatives, this isn't a good choice anymore for my first category.",Slightly Harsh
Black Velvet 1.75l,"I have been drinking BV for over 5 years. I first purchased it for its affordability and its name (all things black...). I first used it to make Whisky Sours for the kids at my local cineplex on New Year's Eve a few years back. Subsequently, I used it as the prime ingredient in Highballs for myself. Perfect. However, I began expanding my horizons in the area of whisk(e)y consumption a couple of years ago. I now have the beginning of a wall-o-whisk(e)y (27 various whiskies), including some nice Scotch up to and including Johnnie Walker Black. As my tongue became more sophisticated, during the relentless pursuit of the intoxicating wonders found in whiskies, I tried good ol' Black Velvet (kept on a separate counter) neat and over ice. Sadly, it's not in the realm of the other sipping whiskies, be they Irish, Scotch, American (Jack No. 7), Rye or Bourbon...and certainly not in the league of Crown Royal Canadian Whisky. I rate it in the middle of the mixers: above Canadian Springs, America's Pride Canadian Whisky (love the name...drank it on election day) and Trader Joe's Premium, but below Canadian Club and Seagram's VO. Coincidentally, that is the same order as their typical ascending prices. Confirming, at least in this application, the old adage, ""you get what you pay for."" I moved up to Canadian Club last month and will try Seagram's VO next month in concocting my Highballs (easy cocktail of choice). In the meantime, I am going to try Black Velvet 8-year this holiday season, as I didn't know about it until reading a recent review. I will add my experience to this review accordingly.",Best As A Mixer
Black Velvet 1.75l,"My husband usually drinks Crown on the rocks, but was looking for something less expensive. I bought this for him to try. In the beginning he said ""it's okay, just different"". After drinking it a few times, he says it's actually pretty good and I should buy more.",Good To Drink On The Rocks
Black Velvet 1.75l,BV makes a great Manhattan. It has enough punch that the whisky taste is not overpowered by the vermouth and bitters. Its also a decent drink with a splash and some ice.,A Good Mixer
Black Velvet 1.75l,I have been drinking BV for years and it's always great. it's smooth &Mixes well with coke or water or if you prefer straight over ice. It's great for any occasion & I recommend it anyone looking for a great whiskey...,My Favorite Whiskey
Black Velvet 1.75l,Black Velvet is my go to Canadian Whiskey. It is always consistent in color and flavor.,"Black Velvet ""Old Reliable"""
Black Velvet 1.75l,"Let me begin my saying that I am not a big whiskey drinker. I mostly adhere to Vodka and Wine. However things do get boring after awhile so I decided on something else. Now, I've had Jack Daniels before and found it to be a bit too strong for me, and Jim Beam being way to much of a burn to drink straight. So after explaining my situation to a work colleague, he recommended this and let me say it is a fine recommendation. The taste is well balanced and it does not burn all the way down. Very smooth and well worth the price if what you are looking for is a good rookie level whiskey to develop a knack for the stuff. It also makes a good mixer.",Smooth
Black Velvet 1.75l,best booze ever my family has drank it as long as i can remeber the ladies might like it with a teaspoon of cherry juice makes it a little sweeter happy drinking,THE B.V.
Black Velvet 1.75l,Black Velvet has become my bourbon of choice. Not because it is inexpensive but because it is stout enough for men for but mild enough for women. I drink it over the rocks and lightly mixed with cola or 7up. It satisfies my taste buds without overpowering them like many popular bourbons.,Mild But Manly

Maker'S Mark Bourbon Whisky 50ml,"I’ve tried many of the cult bourbons: Maker’s Mark, Angel’s Envy, Four Roses, Buffalo Trace, Wild Turkey, and Bulleit. But this is the one I keep coming back to, especially for cocktails (Angel’s Envy is my favorite neat, but only by a very narrow margin). Maker’s Mark is so much rounder, smoother, and more mellow than most other bourbons I’ve tried. It makes for a truly spectacular whiskey sour or old fashioned, that puts the other bourbons in my bar to shame. 10/10 recommend. For the price, it really can’t be beat.",Fantastic Bourbon; You Can’T Go Wrong

Maker'S Mark Bourbon Whisky 50ml,"Nose: There's some scorched oak dashing out when it's poured into the glass. A little alcoholic. After a few minutes, some sweet note like brown sugar starts to show. Then caramel.  Palate: Smooth and mellow, almost no bite. Very weak char in the front and it's soon gone. The oak is around all the time, making the palate quite woody, but not overwhelming. The body is light and tastes very sweet almost like licorice.  Finish: Still woody but no astringency at all. A little nutty in the beginning. There's malty sweetness lingers long, then turns into pear and apple zest. Cool and dry.  Comment: I believe this is one of the mellowest bourbons. But to my surprise, it's quite wood-focused, not just some plain sweet drink. The oak is nicely done, pleasantly running through the palate and lasting long in the finish. The nutty note in the finish is a little highlight to me, which could be attributed to the wheat and barley in their mash bill. The whole experience could be even better if that scorched oak on the nose is fixed.",Very Approachable

Maker'S Mark Bourbon Whisky 50ml,"I have been trying the pints (375ml) size of different bourbons to get a feel or taste of what I like & don't like in a bourbon w/o paying for a full 750ml or 1L bottle & then I find out I don't like it. Well all bourbons are whiskeys.... BUT, not all whiskeys are bourbon. The mashbill or recipe is a little different than most bourbons. Makers Mark has no Rye. It has wheat in it, & it does smooth out any of the rough edges unlike some of the other bourbons in that 90 to 95 proof range. It has all the basics... ie. The vanilla, caramel, with a very small hint of cherry. Great neat room temp or keep it in the fridge & pour it neat. It's good with a mixer too.",Very Nice Wheat Bourbon For The Price

Uncle Nearest 1856 750ml,"I notice that people seem to be having completely different responses to this whiskey, and it makes me wonder if there are large differences from batch to batch. I did get some burn on the back end, which others didn't seem to experience. In addition to the notes in the description, I also got a little bit of menthol on the back. That butterscotch is the first thing that hits me when I sip, followed by some woodiness. IMO, this whiskey was much improved with a little dilution, which tamed the burn and brought that menthol back to more of the vanilla note that is advertised. I would have rated it lower before I tried diluting it. Diluted, I think it is OK, but you can certainly do better for the money.",Wonder About The Consistency

It is what I would call ""smooth"" which I hate using that word, but I think that's what is working against it, it's almost so smooth that there are no distinguishing traits to it, it's just boring. It's fairly well rounded but nothing jumps out, and it lacks the sweetness that I get from other whiskies.

Not that I am a snob by any means. I just prefer single malt. Based on the reviews I was expecting a lot of smoke. I didn’t get it. There is a subtle smoke in the nose and taste but nothing prominent. I did get the sweet, fruity nose which followed in the taste. The finish is gone in a second so don’t expect any lingering flavors. Still, it’s good. It’s a smooth and enjoyable scotch. Pretty similar to. Glenlivet Founders Reserve (which is a good thing).

Buchanan'S 12 Yr 1.75l,"I had written off Scotch years ago. I received a bottle of Buchanan's 12 yr as a gift and immediately wrote it off. I decided to give it a try. I poured a glass and sipped it slowly. I immediately noticed the light smoke flavor which is my favorite part. The smoke flavor was everything to me. Prior to drinking Buchanan's, I enjoyed an occasional glass of Crown Royal. Now, I cannot drink Crown anymore, it just cannot compare to the flavor that Buchanan's offers. I understand that the two should not be compared as they are different however I am sharing my real experiences with the two. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND BUCHANAN'S, especially if you're not a huge fan of Scotch or Blended Scotch. This is a great place to start. I am at the very beginning of my Scotch journey. I am looking to try the smokier Scotches and go from there. I tried the Macallan 12 a few times and I can say it wasn't for me. I've also tried Johnny Walker Blue Label and again, wasn't impressed. I think a lot of people would think I was crazy for liking Buchanan's more than the Macallan.",Amazing Flavor/S - High Quality

Buchanan'S 12 Yr 1.75l,Tittle pretty much says it all. An overtly smokey blended. In my tasting of nearly 600 different scotches i've concluded there is not much middle ground when it comes to smokiness. You either like it or you don't.,"If You Don'T Like Smokey Scotch, Pass."

Buchanan'S 12 Yr 1.75l,"Some might say it’s overrated (at least in this city) but it’s too good to pass up. It has a rich, and heavy taste -not everyone’s cup of tea. Favorite way to drink it? Tons of ice & some orange juice or some squirt (grapefruit soda)",

Buchanan'S 12 Yr 1.75l,"This is a very agreeable blended Scotch whisky. Over rocks, it's very smooth and with obvious peat smoke overtones which I like. That said, the peat smoke is not ""in your face"" (i.e. like a burnt out building) like you get with an Islay whisky (e.g. Laphroaig, Lagavulin or Finlaggan). It's my new favorite and will probably be yours too...",Very Smooth With Some Obvious Peat Smoke
Buchanan'S 12 Yr 1.75l,Smooth and very refreshing i like the taste not too strong and not too soft either and it defidently does the job and with some pineapple juice even better,
Buchanan'S 12 Yr 1.75l,It's a smooth affordable scotch whiskey you can enjoy on the rocks . Or simply add a splash of soda or juice. I prefer pineapple juice . I wouldn't do anything to improve it I think it's perfect.  The flavor is exquisite goes smooth yet warm on the throath. This is my go to whiskey I would definitely continue purchasing. ,

Buchanan'S 12 Yr 1.75l,"I like this whiskey a lot. My main issue is the bottle design with the ball stopper in the top- I've had a lot of issues with being unable to get the whiskey to pour because of the ball being stuck. It's an okay price, and I would buy again for sure.",
Buchanan'S 12 Yr 1.75l,I like that this one is affordable and still pretty smooth. You can enjoy it by itself or mixed.,
Buchanan'S 12 Yr 1.75l,I decided to purchase it and try it out something very new. I would say its a little on the expensive side. I use ginger ale to mix it with not bad honestly. It really doesnt compare to anything its really unique. I would recommend it if you like strong liquor.,
Buchanan'S 12 Yr 1.75l,"To be honest I haven't tried any other kinds of scotch, I mean I wouldn't mind either but I don't drink much unless I'm savoring it. Since this is the first kind of Scotch whisky I've ever tasted I absolutely enjoyed it. Specially mixed with cranberry juice on ice! I would say I'm a repeat consumer, but as I mentioned before I don't drink often so a 750 Ml bottle lasts me quite a while. I would definitely go and replace it as soon as the current bottle is down to the last drop in a heartbeat, thats for sure. Buchanans Buchanans Scotch Deluxe 12 Year 750Ml",

I put it a notch above the Duncan Taylor 12 and 2 notches above the Dewar's 12 but that is just a personal preference. It is still a $30 bottle and a blend so it is better than your average but not designed for a special occasion treat. Try it with one large cube of ice.",Better Than Your Average $30 Bottle

Great when mixing, and also stood on its own on the rocks with a twist of lemon. It's not Crown, but less expensive and definitely worth a try. It's now my go to.

Ellington Canadian Whisky 50ml,What a comparable Whisky for an unbelievable price point. My guest usually drink Manhattans when dining at my home. I tried Ellington when mixing a large quantity and to my surprise the comments were great. First they wanted to know if I had used a new bitter. I politely said if I tell you I will have to kill you ! One guest opened the liquor cabinet and pulled out my secret. I didn't tell her so she is still walking around with a grin on her face.,"Soft, Smooth Lady Like!"

Ellington Canadian Whisky 50ml,"I was talked into trying this at Total Wine a few years ago. At that time, I was very pleased both with the price and the flavor. My go to was Crown Royal prior to trying the Ellington and I had no problem switching away from the Crown. I drink my whiskey and bourbons on the rocks. After drinking Ellington for more than a year, I opened a fresh bottle and the only thing I could describe the flavor as is radiator fluid. I had 3 more bottles and opened another with the same result. I contacted the manufacturer and got no response. Total Wine was zero help as well. Now I wouldn’t drink this trash on a bet!",Started Out Well
Ellington Canadian Whisky 50ml,Not bad for cheap whiskey,Whiskey
Ellington Canadian Whisky 50ml,The flavor is nice with some vanilla notes. Not harsh and has no strong alcohol bite. The middle is pleasant and warm. The end though seems to just disappear.

I have now bought several bottles, and it is an extraordinary value on top of it's great taste.

Ensign Red is the closest to Crown, but it is barely a couple of bucks cheaper. I had picked up a 99 cent bottle of this and was frankly stunned at how good this whisky was. I drank that neat and there was barely any bite. On my next trip to TW, I was even more stunned to find out that a fifth was just 11 bucks. I frankly cant tell the difference between this and Crown. Smooth for its price and a very decent nose. Very very easy to drink it straight in a cold glass or as a Cocktail. I frankly cant find a better value for cocktails than this.",Nice Crown Alternative

Mizunara Oak barrels are rare and expensive to begin with - require a tree to be at least 200 years old and straight (with most Mizunara trees being curved).

The Shin Japanese Malt Whisky 15 Year 750ml,"I took a risk in purchasing this whisky, why? I do not know if the spirit actually is 100% Japanese spirit.

The Shin Japanese Malt Whisky 15 Year 750ml,"This is ""fake"" Japanese whiskey. As in, it's not actually distilled in Japan. They import whiskey from abroad, store it in Japanese barrels for some time, then package it up and market as Japanese whiskey (which is actually legal by Japan's standards.) They seem to be a new brand trying to capitalize on the popularity of Japanese whiskey while the likes of Suntory, Nikka, etc. are hard to get. Also seem to have a shady online presence, with no real information of any substance to be found, aside from barebones marketing pages, and also appear to be absent on the websites they claim to have won awards from.",Misleading

The Shin Japanese Malt Whisky 15 Year 750ml,"I picked this up along with the 10 year and I am really impressed. While the Shin is likely off barrels from Shinobu, it's still a great buy at the price. I get a caramel/vanilla vibe that's very sherry-like and that herbal/earthy finish that comes from the mizunara oak. Not everyday you can get a 15 year japanese whisky at this price. Should not be compared to the likes of yamazaki or hakushu but similar attributes to the nikka youichi. Definitely worth a try before you buy if you can find a bar that has it.",Excellent Value For A 15 Year Japanese Whisky

The Shin Japanese Malt Whisky 15 Year 750ml,"My wife bought this for me thinking it was a Japanese whisky (that was made in Japan). It's not. Tastes fine but it's overpriced for a scotch that is rebottled with a Japanese label. If you want ""real"" Japanese whisky, trust Suntory (Yamazaki, Hakushu, Hibiki, Toki), Nikka, Akashi, Ichiro's Malt, Mars, Akkeshi, Akasa, Nagahama, Shizuoka, and Kanosuke. The ones after Mars can't really be found in the US just yet but those are all legit producers.",Do Not Mistake For Japanese Whisky

Michter'S US1 American Whiskey 750ml,"Hearing the hype from the typical Whiskeytube personalities, I was excited to finally find a bottle. I find it to be an average whiskey. The issues for me are primarily the proof. You get a lot of the classic vanillas and caramels of a typical bourbon, but since this is matured in second fill bourbon barrels, it has to be called American Whiskey and is a lot tamer. For me, the combination of second fill and low proof equate to a more watery whiskey, with hints of bourbon. Personally, I feel there are better options at $40, such as Rare Breed, or a Woodford's Double Oak for $45. And if you just want something lighter (in proof), I prefer the previously mentioned Double Oak, an Eagle Rare or even Maker's 46.",Average Whiskey Not Worth The Hunt

I never add water and I did here trying get around the nose and a bit of the “off” taste on this one. It’s a small batch so it may be the anomaly.

Michter'S US1 American Whiskey 750ml,Yes it may not be considered a bourbon but the taste and mellowness is nothing to sneeze at. Michter's tried something different and put their elixir in used oak casks. When they bottled this beautiful liquid it came out as 83.1 proof. This gave it no burn any ware on the palate and when swallowed it went down the throat like warm melted mozzarella cheese. There was the taste of caramel and vanilla but the were pushed to the back leaving the taste of wild berries and dried fruit to shine through. At $36 to $37 it's a little pricy for an everyday go to.

Shepherd'S P'Nutty Peanut Butter Whiskey 750ml,"It has a good, smooth Kentucky whiskey base. That was about the only thing I really liked about it. It’s good if you’re looking for a sweet whiskey liqueur, but you’ll be disappointed if you’re expecting a strong peanut butter flavor. What you get is a very sweet, strong butterscotch candy flavor that overshadows the peanut butter. This was way too sweet and butterscotch candy tasting for me. Peanut butter doesn’t taste like sweet candy, but rather more meaty which is why salt is usually added to bring out the natural nutty flavor. This should be called a butterscotch whiskey, not a peanut butter whiskey, IMO.",Butterscotch Brittle With Some Peanuts Flavor

Stranahan'S Colorado Whiskey 750ml,"Originally, the bottle had caught my eye in store but I was a bit skeptical at first. Once I bought a bottle a almost immediately purchased a second. Most often, I sip my whiskey straight or over ice, but I do enjoy making an old fashioned every now and then. This is now one of my favorite whiskeys for and Old Fashioned. There is a nice spice to it and when a bit of a bite that works very well sugar and bitters. The Old Fashioned cuts through some of the bite and the spice complements the orange in the drink and creates something phenomenal.",Great For An Old Fashioned
Stranahan'S Colorado Whiskey 750ml,"This has a pretty unique flavor. It starts with things like toffee, butterscotch, and cherries. There's a nice malty backbone... it's brighter than bourbon. There's some nuts in there, and a bit medicinal. Medium finish. I'd say it's worth the buy, but for me to go back to it again and again, the price would need to be a bit lower. It's fresh and flavorful, but young.",Tasty Stuff

Stranahan'S Colorado Whiskey 750ml,"Just did a tour to the Distillery in Denver Colorado. Lots of love put on the process and excellent product at the end. Aged in charred barrels, each batch is different. Very strong whiskey with beautiful color from the oak and great flavors in it. Highly recommended.",Great Whiskey
Stranahan'S Colorado Whiskey 750ml,"Each batch is about 5 barrels compared to know Creek which is about 500 barrels. I did a tour of the distillery 10/2014. Learned alot about this distillery. It's very micro from ingredientz, mash , fermentation, aging, bottling, clean up and no automation which Includes the bottling room where volunteers write each batch number and a small short message on each bottle affixed to the label hand applied not machine applied. . The bottlers are all volunteer and only do it for the fun, experience, free pizza, 80's music and the 1 free bottle at the end they take home for volunteering. This is all done with passion and love and at $49 it's a deal, pick one up drink it and love it. If you are ever In denver Colorado get a free tour with samples and learn about the amazing process and love that is put into this and every batch. Since its not automated not every batch is identical. Fyi even the cleaning of the copper pots is hand done not automated.",Under Rated @$49 Ea. It'S A Deal

Sazerac 6 Year Old Rye Whiskey 750ml,"Sazerac is one of the finer Ryes available at any cost. It's clean, has a fresh grassy rye flavor, not minty like some ryes, and it never disappoints. It's not for lovers of Canadian Ryes that are so smooth you can't taste the familiar American Rye bite, but the bite is just like a bit of pepper on the end.

Sazerac 6 Year Old Rye Whiskey 750ml,"I had tried some Rye in the past, but found it to be too sharp and tasteless; mostly sharp on the gullet and stomach... Then, I started watching an amazing show!

Excellent citrus/honey flavor with a hint of rye burn. Just what you need on a cold winter night when you feel a cold coming on! Strong (84 proof) libation but with the soothing taste of honey and citrus on top. The bottle label with the back printing of old advertising logos is very interesting, The contents are most enjoyable, with hints of citrus and honey and the fire spice of rye whiskey. This is a most enjoyable libation for the VERY low price of admission. Take a small glass. Sip it. And imagine sitting in an 1800’s pharmacy acquiring this amazing elixir from the pharmacist…….for what allies you. Very enjoyable straight up. Or with one large cube of ice. In a rocks glass.

Slow & Low Rock & Rye Whiskey 750ml,"Very interesting product. It reminds you of an Old Fashioned right out of the bottle. One or two ice cubes with a rocks glass half full and you are on your way. Opening the bottle you immediately smell Earl Grey tea. The taste reminds you of Earl Grey with honey and a kick of straight whiskey... Very flavorful stuff. I can't say that it would be a good mixer because it really already is a mixed drink ready to drink. The bottle is very unique and somewhat ornate. The risque inside label could offend some, but if you are drinking Booze like this, it likely will not. Give it a try. Much better and certainly less sweet than the glorified Schnapps that others are offering under the name Rock & Rye.",Earl Grey In Whiskey Cocktail Form!

I've been bartending for 9 years and this is the best 25$ whiskey I recommend, and I've tried roughly 60 other bourbons up to this point. Noah's Mill is my favorite at the 50$ range but this one is just the most versatile. Great for gentlemen's cocktails. Can be balanced out or taken straight. It's a very comfortable experience. Doesn't have the kick that is expected of most rye whiskey and goes down like a bourbon, but I still appreciate the spicy tones. It just does a lot of simple things right.

Slow & Low Rock & Rye Whiskey 750ml,"A friend and I were looking for something new to try. The thought of an old fashioned mixed cocktail already in a bottle is an appealing idea. This fails on every level. The orange is overpoweringly cheap liqueur. I really can't speak as to the quality of the rye itself, since you can't even taste it. We tried it with ice, neat, cut with water, cut with other whiskey... nothing made it even to a level we felt was drinkable, much less good. We tried to find anybody who would take the bottle and none of our friends or relatives would even take it for free after trying it. Simply awful, I don't understand how it has so many 5 star reviews. Do yourself a favor and buy a bottle of decent rye, like bulleit, and learn how to make a proper Sazerac.

I also grab a bottle of Diamond Peak from time to time, and have consumed a bottle of the Sherry Cask. So outside of Snowflake, I’m a well versed Stranahan’s drinker. This new Blue Peak product has me astounded. It’s priced a little more affordably, but has an incredible character. It’s uniquely different, potentially being my new favorite. I’ve been A/B comparing both an original bottle and thus Blue Peak over the past couple weeks and cannot believe how good this stuff is. I conclusively have determined the nose on this is better than the original. In comparison the original has an odd almost musky hint to the nose, which almost gives me thoughts of tequila. The Blue Peak has none of that but instead just sweetness and spiciness. When it comes to mouth feel and taste, the jury is still out. Both have pros of their own, but I can honestly say this Blue Peak is something special. I was so impressed I ran out and bought a second bottle.

I'll start with saying it is very unique, and because of this, may not be for everyone. That being said, it has become one of my favorite ryes, and a favorite of multiple friends and family. The nose reminds me of Indian spices. Heavy gingerbread and Christmas baking spices. Bold flavors on the palate - a perfect marriage of high rye covered in sweetness from the rum casks. I am not a fan of high ryes myself - I typically stick to barely legal ryes. But the sweetness imparted by the rum casks makes it so enjoyable. Good mouthfeel. As a high proof hound, I wonder if this would be better at 107, but I'm really splitting hairs. I understand it may be too sweet for some; this is not an everyday drinker. Think of it as a sweet dessert whiskey, good for a pour once a week.

Angel'S Envy Rye Whiskey 750ml,My boyfriend loves this whiskey! I gave it one less star because it’s a bit expensive for middle of the road whiskey.,
Angel'S Envy Rye Whiskey 750ml,"A syrupy sweet, fruity mess. Tastes and smells like a booze-soaked fruit cake that gets recirculated every Christmas.

Angel'S Envy Rye Whiskey 750ml,"This rye is finished in rum casks, and I suppose that is the source of the sweetness. Whatever the source, this rye drinks more like a liqueur, and it so cloyingly sweet that I end up mixing it with a spicy rye to make it palatable.",Too Sweet

I did NOT like the Angel's Envy Bourbon, but was very surprised at the complexity and delicious taste of this rye. Spreads widely across the palate instead of just the top or back of the mouth.

Angel'S Envy Rye Whiskey 750ml,I don’t care for the AE bourbon but this is much different. A very mellow rye with a hint of spice. The sweetness from the rum is much more apparent that I expected but not in a bad way. Very good neat as a sipper without the heat. Def recommend.,4.5 Stars
Angel'S Envy Rye Whiskey 750ml,"Angel's Envy Finished Rye is an interesting tug of war between the spiciness of the rye and sweetness of the rum it was finished in. As someone coming from the more sweet/mellow taste of Bourbon, I was initial off put by the spice of a 95% Rye, but the it grew on me. Very sweet on the nose and finish, with a fair bite on the pallet. Tasty stuff, but try before you buy if you never had a Rye before.",Something Different
Angel'S Envy Rye Whiskey 750ml,"I've been building up my whiskey and bourbon collections, and managed to get the only bottle of this I have ever seen in a store. Given the stellar ratings and other reviews, I just knew I was in for a real treat. I could not have been more disappointed. This has a VERY prominent overtone of Maple. On a personal note, I loathe Maple and could consequently not overcome that aversion when drinking this. Outside of that and from a strictly empirical standpoint, I found the whiskey to be a bit harsh and lackluster. I have much better bottles in my collection that cost far less.",Not Recommended
Angel'S Envy Rye Whiskey 750ml,"In all my years of drinking bourbon and I know this is not. I have never encountered a more appealing to the nose spirit. Notes of butterscotch, strong vanilla, burnt caramel almost reminiscent of a beautiful scented candle. And the taste is awesome 100 proof but no big burn. Delightful delightful delightful. Have recommended to at leaf 10 friends! Not a rye guy but this phenomenal.",This Will Blow You Away
Angel'S Envy Rye Whiskey 750ml,"I've been reluctant to spend the extra money to get the Rye version of Angel's Envy as I have been more than impressed with their original. That's until now. I am sipping Angel's Envy Rye as I write this. This is awesome bourbon. It blew me away! The aroma is like honey roasted walnuts. The first sip grabs your attention as you immediately taste caramel, butterscotch and vanilla. All this as it coats your palate in a dry and not overwhelmingly sweet note. It lingers in your palate with warm vanilla notes. This is without a doubt the best Rye Bourbon I have ever tasted. Well worth the money..",Stunningly Good!

2 Gingers Irish Whiskey 750ml,After reading all the wonderful reviews I was excited to try 2 Gingers. But it was for not. I purchased it over the internet. When I opened the package my first alarm was it was distilled by Kilbeggan's. I purchased a bottle of Tyrconnell's that was distilled by Kilbeggan's. They both have the same color and taste. Except this wasn't $40. This bottle had a bitter finish and I believe only distilled twice. I will stick with Bushmills Red Bush as my everyday.

Hudson Do The Rye Thing Straight Rye Whiskey 750ml,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] To be open and honest, this product was incentivized however my opinions are my own. Sometimes past experiences leave a mark that may lead you to pre-judge a product, however having a chance to try Hudson’s Do the Rye Thing you only deprive yourself of fantastic experiences when you do this. The last rye whiskey I tried left me with ‘well that’s rye...oh yeah and some whiskey...meh’ taste in my mouth. Enough time had passed however, so when the offer to give this product a try came around, I walked into it hopeful for a better experience. I was incredibly rewarded by giving this whiskey a try! It’s so incredibly smooth, has that warming effect (with just a bit of that whiskey bite/burn ) and just a light sweet taste, like a mild honey. This whiskey stands so well all on its own, but I can’t wait to try it as a Manhattan, Old Fashioned and beyond! This will be a wonderful addition to have for a quiet evening to yourself or sharing an evening amongst friends. Cheers!",My New Favorite Whiskey

Hudson Do The Rye Thing Straight Rye Whiskey 750ml,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This a decent whiskey. It’s just not very well refined. Although it has good flavor, you can taste the potency. It has wooden and earthy back notes and a touch of spice. It’s best mellowed with a few ice cubes.

Hudson Do The Rye Thing Straight Rye Whiskey 750ml,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I was excited to try this rye whiskey. I remember trying their bourbon years ago, before they changed their labeling, and thought it was good. On the nose: My first sniff was sharp. The alcohol smell was strong but then gave way to a strong caramel apple smell with a hint of tea at the end. Taste: That sharp ethanol burn follows through to the palate. Once you acclimate, the flavors open up to caramel, oak, vanilla, and that funky herbal note you sometimes get in ryes. The caramel and herbal note linger on the palate between sips. Overall, this a good rye whiskey. It is sippable but much better in an old fashioned or Manhattan. For the novice whiskey drinker, I can recommend it. For the more seasoned connoisseur, you might be better served with something else if you are looking to drink it neat.","Good, Better In Cocktails."

Hudson Do The Rye Thing Straight Rye Whiskey 750ml,"Just has an off flavor. Almosted peated, but... Not quite. I love rye and this is very meh.",Not Good
Hudson Do The Rye Thing Straight Rye Whiskey 750ml,"Rye is my preferred American whiskey, which is why I was surprised several years ago to find that the best rye I'd ever tasted was actually made in the Netherlands by the Zuidam folks. A close second was Old Potrero, by the Anchor beer people (70+ bucks, yikes!). This Do The Rye Thing is now my favorite rye, because of its flavor, the fact that I can lay my hands on it, and its reasonable price (for the quality). If you like rye whiskeys like Bulleit, Woodford, Old Forester, etc. (personally I do), those basically taste like dry, spicy bourbons compared to this (I like bourbon too). This has a significantly different flavor profile from more common rye whiskeys, I just love it. You can really taste the rye, it's kind of like the smell of rye crisps or bread, or freshly ground grains. There's nothing wrong with the more widely available ryes out there, but I'm tempted to say that THIS is what real rye tastes like. And I can confirm that it makes a splendid Manhattan. If you like this, by the way, you'll love ryes by Zuidam, Leopold Bros, and Old Potrero (all harder to find where I am, and/or pricier).",My New Favorite Rye

Old Overholt Bonded Whiskey 750ml,After trying the regular proof Overholt I thought I’d give this a try. If you read my previous review you’d know this was the preferred whiskey of the one and only Doc Holliday. It certainly tastes good in a saloon in Tombstone AZ So I figured I’d give it a try at home. This is a tad more stout than the basic Overholt Whiskey but has a certain smooth character to it in comparison. I enjoy and recommend it.,"If 86 Is Good 100 Is Even Better, Right?"

I would definitely recommend",Not Usually A Fan Of Ryes
Old Overholt Bonded Whiskey 750ml,Seems like most reviews are pretty decent but I couldn’t even force myself to finish the bottle. The nose was fine but every sip just tasted like I shoved my face into a pile of hay. It was the only thing I could taste. Might have been a bad bottle but I’ll never get ur again,Maybe A Bad Bottle?
Old Overholt Bonded Whiskey 750ml,"Lots of buzz already surrounding this whiskey despite it being fairly new on the market. I'm here to set the record straight. Does it taste like the original Overholt? Yes, but better. (More alcohol equals more flavor, lads.) Does it really taste more like a bourbon than a true rye? Yep. This one is sweeter than most people will expect from a whiskey category which is mostly known for being dry, spicy, peppery........... I picked up notes of molasses and (if you can believe it) birch-beer on Overholt Bonded's nose, and lots of sweet corn on its palate. So it's not as sweet as a true bourbon and not as dry as most ryes ... probably a great way for drinkers of one to try the other, and quite versatile for cocktails. (Though I drink it neat so I wouldn't know.) Is it better than Rittenhouse 100? No. Especially if you need your ryes to be really punchy and power with their spicy flavors, because as I said, this one is very sweet and bourbon-like (and so smooth for 100 proof). But Rittenhouse costs $10 more than this. So Overholt is the obvious choice if you're trying to live the high life while also being a broke college kid ... or you care more about value than pure quality.",The Best Buy In Rye

Shepherd'S P'Nutty Peanut Butter Whiskey 50ml,"It has a good, smooth Kentucky whiskey base. That was about the only thing I really liked about it. It’s good if you’re looking for a sweet whiskey liqueur, but you’ll be disappointed if you’re expecting a strong peanut butter flavor. What you get is a very sweet, strong butterscotch candy flavor that overshadows the peanut butter. This was way too sweet and butterscotch candy tasting for me. Peanut butter doesn’t taste like sweet candy, but rather more meaty which is why salt is usually added to bring out the natural nutty flavor. This should be called a butterscotch whiskey, not a peanut butter whiskey, IMO.",Butterscotch Brittle With Some Peanuts Flavor

Rogue Dead Guy Whiskey 750ml,,
Rogue Dead Guy Whiskey 750ml,"This tastes and smells like a teenager. Rancid, turpentine odor with a sickly, stay inside too much sweetness. Upon first drinking it, I got that whiff...maybe nail polish remover, and overripe fruit...and the taste was nearly indistinguishable from that experience. Now, I'm a bourbon drinker but also enjoy the occasional Irish whiskey. This...this was poured out. Sorry. Doesn't even mix well, maybe, because I don't do mixed drinks except the occasional Old Fashioned. So...thanks for the cork? As an aside, my Wife bought this for me, because of the cork and isn't all whiskey bourbon? Lord help me.",Not A Fan

Rogue Dead Guy Whiskey 750ml,"I was pleasantly surprised by the unique caramel and malted barley tones of this! In a world dominated by a ""biting bourbon"" this was a refreshing change of pace. This is mellow and smooth sipping on it's own and cocktailed really well in an egg white sour. My partner who enjoys mixed drinks with soda said it was her new favorite for mixing with root beer and Dr. Pepper (her favorite sodas) I love that Rogue is a company that does everything in house, it shows in the irreplicable flavors in Dead Guy Whiskey. Definitely something we'll keep as a staple in our bar.",A Unique And Flavorful Single Malt Whiskey

Rogue Dead Guy Whiskey 750ml,"This stuff is not that good. I was sold on the bottle which is cool. The only way I finished this bottle was to mix with bitters, cherry juice and Squirt. And that was a stretch.",No Way
Rogue Dead Guy Whiskey 750ml,"If you are looking for a traditional whiskey, like Scotch, Bourbon or Irish, this is not your stuff. But, If you are looking for something new, unique and different in a good way, This should do nicely. I have had a lot of whiskeys even ones you can only buy in their country of origin, but they mostly go for traditional characteristics of their style. That isn't a bad thing, but it's safe. The whiskey world is slowly wakening to the experimental nature of the US beer market. And that is providing lots of experimentation. That is good because it means that the world of whiskey can grow. I'm certainly not saying that there aren't lots of incredible traditional whiskeys. I don't want them to go away. Ever! I just think that there is plenty of room for more and different. That is exactly what DGW is all about. Good job Rogue!",Tasty With Big Cocoa Notes
Rogue Dead Guy Whiskey 750ml,"Fan of Dead Guy ale so I had to try this. It isn't your average, everyday whiskey since it is made from the ale but this new age statement has it really improved from past bottlings. Great by itself and in a cocktail so I will buy again soon.",Unique And Delicious
Rogue Dead Guy Whiskey 750ml,I was so excited to try this whiskey given my experiences with Rogue's Dead Guy and other beers. Bah! I will stick to their beer from now on.,Really Disappointed
Rogue Dead Guy Whiskey 750ml,"It's simply undrinkable, and the unpleasant flavors are strong enough to be apparent in many mixed drinks. It tastes like it's not distilled enough times and/or not filtered and definitely not aged long. It's like they didn't have anyone that knows anything about whiskey to taste test it before they bottled it.",Terpentine
Rogue Dead Guy Whiskey 750ml,Never head another whiskey this bad. Very sweet and not good flavor.,Stick To Their Beer
Rogue Dead Guy Whiskey 750ml,"When Rogue first started distilling spirits back in 2003, they apparently thought they could ""speed-age"" whiskey into a drinkable product. It apparently took them over a decade to learn they were horribly mistaken. For years, Rogue ""whiskeys"" were not even worthy of being called whiskey. That is no longer the case, with their new whiskeys all being aged in Oregon oak barrels for at least 2 years. Dead Guy whiskey is distilled from a wash made from their world-famous Dead Guy Ale (without the hops added, I'm told). The Oregon oak (quercus garryana) aging adds more of a spiciness, rather than the sweeter vanilla notes that would result from American white oak (quercus alba). Apparently, Rogue also makes their own barrels right there in Newport, Oregon. That's pretty cool. If you haven't tried Rogue whiskeys lately, you should. They must have hired a distiller who really knows what he's doing.",Amazing Improvement!
Rogue Dead Guy Whiskey 750ml,Found it smooth and easy to drink...Loved the oak taste!,Very Smooth!
Rogue Dead Guy Whiskey 750ml,"I too am a Rogue fan, love Dead Guy Ale and enjoy Rogue's Single Malt but the Dead Guy Whisky is horrible. I keep re-reading their tasting notes and shake my head, not even close. This tastes more like really bad tequila. Rogue should do themselves a favor and pull this off the market until they can re-tool it, just bad for their brand.",Nasty
Rogue Dead Guy Whiskey 750ml,I eventually choked down this bottle when every whiskey or rum or vodka in the house was gone and the stores were closed. I drink Dead Guy Ale all the time but this Whiskey was awful.,Nasty
Rogue Dead Guy Whiskey 750ml,"I picked this up on sale. I've always enjoyed products from Rogue and figured it was worth a shot. However, even at the discounted price, it was disappointing. It tastes young. It's harsh without really any defining flavor. I know there are people who like the white whiskey, and if that's your thing then this might be for you, but I didn't enjoy it. I only use it for mixers at this point. There are plenty of other whiskeys out there at half the price that perform much better.",Not Worth It
Jameson Cold Brew Irish Whiskey 750ml,I love this drink..smooth great taste. I recommend it highly,Great Taste
Jameson Cold Brew Irish Whiskey 750ml,Bought it at a local store thinking it would be like a craft beer made with real coffee. I drink whiskey straight neat and this is too off. It is like some kind of harsh coffee made from the tombs of Egypt. I looked it up and they don’t use actual coffee when making this. I have a hunch real Jameson and a bit of real cold brew would be more palette-able. I wish I got Starbucks black cold brew and regular Jameson instead of this stuff at its 30% ABV. Not horrible but definitely not something you want to drink at evenings or night due to the caffeine.,Too Strong With Caffeine

If I had not grown up on Jameson I would probably say this is the best Irish for under $30-$35 hands down. Very popular in ireland. If this was $40 a bottle I would still give 4/5 stars.

(my previous favorite)... more bite (less smooth), slightly less character. Still nice after all these years. 4th glass, same set-up: Kavanaugh...smoother, but sweeter, less character. Good for the ladies. 5th glass, same set-up: Paddy again. I prefer this, slightly over Tully and noticeably over the others. I am lit. Time for some Irish stew with lamb.

By now I'm sure you're wondering what this has to do with fiction, I am currently reading a wonderful series written by Graham Masterton about Detective Superintendent Katie Maguire and it is the drink of choice, likely since both the story and the whiskey are located in Cork.

Kilbrin Blended Irish Whiskey 1.75l,"The Total Wine associate asked if she could help me find something. I said ""No, I'll probably just get what I always get. So I browsed until 8:55 pm. It's a rare occasion that I try something new, but after walking the aisles several times, I kept stopping at the same spot, looking at that bottle of Kilbrin, thinkin' ""Yeah!"" I chose it because the bottle had a full seal but wasn't too fancy, no appealing picture, just a short description and a reasonable price, but not too low. When I cut the seal, I knew I made a good decision. There was no screw-off top, but instead, a cork. I just smiled and raised the bottle. There's nothing like a cold shot of good whiskey. Cold or room temperature, straight or mixed, Kilbrin Blended Irish Whiskey goes down smooth and easy. It's premium whiskey without the premium price tag. So quit thinking about it. Pick it up, take it home and pull the cork! You'll be glad you did.",Smooth & Easy

Kilbrin Blended Irish Whiskey 1.75l,"This whiskey tastes bright and tinty, almost metallic, with no addition character. Would not recommend",Metallic And Basic
Kilbrin Blended Irish Whiskey 1.75l,"I would say that this whiskey is light and approachable. It does however have a little more bite and a spicier finish than other budget irish whiskey I have had. The reason it only received a 3 from me is that it seems to be missing the buttery biscuit mid palate flavor that I expect from an Irish whiskey. It is overall sweet with tastes of fruit and vanilla and a little short bread. Smooth, sweet easy sipper with a slight spice finish. This is decent beginer Irish whiskey but not necessarily one I would keep on my shelf regularly. I would say for about 5 dollars more, budget Jameson is more complex and a better representation of Irish whiskey.",Simple And Easy.
Kilbrin Blended Irish Whiskey 1.75l,Maybe it's just me but I found those whiskey pretty meh overall. First glass I poured over a stone smelled harsh. The first few sips I get the spice that lingers a bit and just a touch of vanilla that fades pretty quickly. Far smoother then I first thought it would be based on the smell. All and all for me not bad so I'll be finishing the bottle but not something I am likely to buy again.,Not My Glass Of Whiskey

Kilbrin Blended Irish Whiskey 1.75l,"I would recommend this to someone just starting in the Irish Whiskey range. It is very very mild & cheap. Your not going to get alot of complexity off this, but it can be very easy to sip neat for beginners. I personally like that this is first young whiskey to come out of the Brand New Tullamore Distillery. Knowing that the DEW has a slight hand in this makes a lot of sense.

Kilbrin Blended Irish Whiskey 1.75l,"Mellow whiskey. Vanilla, cream on the palate, moves to buttered toast and typical irish spice on the finish.

Kilbrin Blended Irish Whiskey 750ml,"The Total Wine associate asked if she could help me find something. I said ""No, I'll probably just get what I always get. So I browsed until 8:55 pm. It's a rare occasion that I try something new, but after walking the aisles several times, I kept stopping at the same spot, looking at that bottle of Kilbrin, thinkin' ""Yeah!"" I chose it because the bottle had a full seal but wasn't too fancy, no appealing picture, just a short description and a reasonable price, but not too low. When I cut the seal, I knew I made a good decision. There was no screw-off top, but instead, a cork. I just smiled and raised the bottle. There's nothing like a cold shot of good whiskey.

Kilbrin Blended Irish Whiskey 750ml,"I would say that this whiskey is light and approachable. It does however have a little more bite and a spicier finish than other budget irish whiskey I have had. The reason it only received a 3 from me is that it seems to be missing the buttery biscuit mid palate flavor that I expect from an Irish whiskey. It is overall sweet with tastes of fruit and vanilla and a little short bread. Smooth, sweet easy sipper with a slight spice finish. This is decent beginer Irish whiskey but not necessarily one I would keep on my shelf regularly. I would say for about 5 dollars more, budget Jameson is more complex and a better representation of Irish whiskey.",Simple And Easy.
Kilbrin Blended Irish Whiskey 750ml,Maybe it's just me but I found those whiskey pretty meh overall. First glass I poured over a stone smelled harsh. The first few sips I get the spice that lingers a bit and just a touch of vanilla that fades pretty quickly. Far smoother then I first thought it would be based on the smell. All and all for me not bad so I'll be finishing the bottle but not something I am likely to buy again.,Not My Glass Of Whiskey

Kilbrin Blended Irish Whiskey 750ml,"I would recommend this to someone just starting in the Irish Whiskey range. It is very very mild & cheap. Your not going to get alot of complexity off this, but it can be very easy to sip neat for beginners.

Kilbrin Blended Irish Whiskey 750ml,"Mellow whiskey. Vanilla, cream on the palate, moves to buttered toast and typical irish spice on the finish.

Clyde May'S Whiskey 750ml,"Clyde May’s Alabama Style Whiskey, 85 proof, 42.5% abv Nose: alcohol, citrus, molasses, honey, leather, sweet corn, very pleasant Taste: corn forward, brown sugar, leather, apple (like honeycrisp, sweet not at all tart), cinnamon, small spicy bite, cinnamon roll and oak finish. Second taste heavier corn; adds leather after brown sugar, small spicy bite becomes fused with cinnamon for red hots, then apple comes through for a bright finish. Overall: Heavy corn flavor to start so be a fan of that; develops quickly and pleasantly; leaves me wishing the finish would linger instead of fading fairly soon. Really enjoy when cinnamon roll flavor comes through. This is a good\decent sipping whiskey with an attractive price point.",Solid Sipper For The Price Point
Clyde May'S Whiskey 750ml,"I accidentally discovered Clyde May's Conecuh Ridge in 2004 in Alabama, while on a golf trip. The golf course bar had a conference in the night before and drank them dry of Jack Daniels. A buddy tried this stuff and raved about it. 20 golfers later, we had all tried it and made a beeline for the ""ABC Store"" and bought them out. It was difficult to find outside of Alabama for years, due in part, to some legal issues from on-line sales. Needless to say, when it finally became available again, my friends and I bought a case at a time and split it. What do I like about it? For starters, it's very smooth and flavorful. I adore the caramel smell and taste. It's a little sweeter than a lot of whiskey's, but not overly so. I agree with another reviewer that you should open the bottle, let it sit for 10 min or so before drinking it. I like mine straight over ice and refer to it as my 'sipping whiskey'. For the money, it's by far my favorite whiskey! It's changed somewhat over the years, for example it was originally 90 proof (my current bottle is listed as 85 proof), known as Clyde May's 'Conecuch Ridge' whiskey and made in Alabama. Now it's known as ""Clyde May's Alabama Style Whiskey"" and was bottled in Texas. I don't believe the flavor has changed over the past decade and I strongly recommend you try this product. I don't think you'll be disappointed.",My Favorite Whiskey!
Clyde May'S Whiskey 750ml,"Super smooth, rich body, has a note of green apple, but nowhere near being a flavored whiskey. Very tasty.","Super Smooth, Great Taste"
Clyde May'S Whiskey 750ml,"What a surprise it was to discover this, Not really a bourbon drinker, and this isn't. But the unique flavor was wonderful. Can easily tell the caramel and vanilla in just the right notes. Easy on the wood and char, but it's there. Even at this elevated proof, it's sippable, particularly on a single cube. Straight Neat or cube is the way to enjoy.",Wow- What A Surprise-A Good One

Clyde May'S Whiskey 750ml,"I have a fairly extensive whiskey collection, heavy on bourbon, and while this is not the most complex bourbon by any means, it is simply delicious!

Clyde May'S Whiskey 750ml,"I disagree with those who have described this as a flavored whiskey, as those are usually lower proof and cloyingly sweet. My wife and I both enjoy Clyde May's neat, but I don't pick up the apple that others seem to. To me, the taste is reminiscent of cherry Sucrets: kind of a medicinal sweetness. It's unlike the other whiskeys and bourbons I've tried, but in a good way. This has earned a spot in my collection.",Not A Flavored Whiskey
Clyde May'S Whiskey 750ml,"I bought this to drink neat and was shocked when I poured myself a glass and took a sip. It didn't say ""Apple flavored"" on the bottle. It was $30 and 85 proof.

Clyde May'S Whiskey 750ml,"Recommended by TW personnel and a great find. Smooth, complex, not too smokey, with just a slight sweetness. Others have commented (some negatively) on the forward apple taste, which I did not experience. I do sense a strong vanilla note on the nose, which is more subdued on the palate. Enjoy neat or with ice. I find Clyde Mays too interesting on its own to mix.",New Favorite Whiskey
Clyde May'S Whiskey 750ml,I discovered this Bourbon at a whiskey tasting and immediately went out and bought a bottle. It's rich and smooth and perfect over ice or neat. It has a rich nose of green apples but it's not an apple flavored bourbon. I repeat this is not a flavored whiskey. Give it a try. I have most of my office addicted to the stuff now.,Smooth And Unique
Clyde May'S Whiskey 750ml,This Alabama style whiskey is like none other. It is the smoothest whiskey I have ever had and when mixed equal parts with water or straight over ice you will truly appreciate the uniqueness of Clyde Mays' original recipe.,Unbelievably Smooth!
Clyde May'S Whiskey 750ml,"Its got a great taste, but the green apple is strong, which is really its only weakness. Its a good sweet though, not like the cheap honey whiskies. After it passes, you'll experience the natural-tasting vanilla and finally it goes down very smoothly. Overall, great quality whiskey, and if you can handle the sweetness, its great by its own.","Good Whisky, But Much Sweeter Than I Expected."
Clyde May'S Whiskey 750ml,"I don't understand it. Why not state clearly on the bottle? Apple flavored whiskey I like a good whiskey on the rocks and was looking to branch out from the usuals, Jack, Jim, Jameson, Bushmills. I guess if you want to pay $30 a bottle for something to make mixed drinks with? This is probably good for that. An old fashioned or a sour, probably pretty good.

Clyde May'S Whiskey 750ml,"There is an underlying sweetness with this and a whole range of flavors as you go from first sip to lingering bliss. It seems to have different qualities straight and with water. Straight, there was a burn, more of a deep warmth, that exploded into almost a brown sugar after-glow. It was smoother with just a splash, and softly spicy in a Manhattan. They say it' makes the best Manhattans you've tasted, Not sure if that's true, but it's a dang good one.","Good Manhattans, As Advertised"
Clyde May'S Whiskey 750ml,"I rarely take time to blog or write reviews but felt that to not share my experience here would be a disservice. I have been enjoying bourbon for almost 40 years .... long before the new glut of boutique brands that come in single barrels, small batches and a host of other formulations. It is almost impossible to have tried them all but I have put quite a dent in that bucket list. And while I now do not drink as much bourbon as I once did, I certainly drink better now than I ever did. There are many really good bourbons and Tennessee whiskeys out there but it was immediately noticeable that there was something special about Clyde May's Whiskey. A pull of the cork releases a full warm aroma of malted molasses that makes you want to take a deep breath. It just gets better from here. On the rocks in a low ball glass, this stuff is as smooth as silk delivering a full rich bourbon flavor with a sweet malted or toasted molasses infusion. I really mean smooth with no burn...just down right delicious. Making it ""neat"" by adding just a touch of water to thin the mixture releases more of this wonderful aroma and makes a drink that is too good to put down. Becareful, you can put away 2-3 of these things before you know what happened. If you are looking for a bourbon that is strong, hot with some burn, this is not for you. But if you are looking for a sophisitcated, unbelievably smooth and rich bourbon, Clyde Mays will offer you something more than you can imagine until you try it. Clyde Mays Bourbon is far and above everything else that I have had the pleasure of enjoying over the past 40 years. I highly recommend that you experience it for yourself.",Mr. Mays Raises The Bourbon Bar To A New Standard

Ritual Zero Proof Non-Alcoholic Whiskey 750ml,"I've sampled all of the Ritual alcohol substitutes and found them pretty gross. In trying to make them ""like"" alchohol (adding capsicum to add the warmth and what appears to be glycol to recreate the viscosity), you end up with a really unpleasant product. It just accentuates what you're missing in a glass of real booze and also covers up what could be a creditable effort to recreate the flavors of whiskey, tequila, and gin.

Ritual Zero Proof Non-Alcoholic Whiskey 750ml,"I bought this to try as an alternative to alcohol for those occasions when zero alcohol is important. Unfortunately it falls quite short if the mark. Taste was very weak and didn’t stand up to ice at all. It is also not the greatest value at over $25 for 750ml, which is quite a bit less than some of the other zero proof options. I tried it straight and didn’t care fir it at all. Next tried in an old fashioned. With no ice this would be ok, but add even a little ice and it tastes very watered down.

There’s a reason they don’t allow reviews on their website.",You Will Not Be Satisfied
Ritual Zero Proof Non-Alcoholic Whiskey 750ml,I was hoping zero alcohol whiskey would at least taste like whiskey. NA beer has gotten so good I can't tell the difference. Spirits have a way to go.,Ritual Zero Proof Whiskey Alt.
Ritual Zero Proof Non-Alcoholic Whiskey 750ml,"Maybe that was the problem. It tastes like tea with red hots.

Ritual Zero Proof Non-Alcoholic Whiskey 750ml,,
Ritual Zero Proof Non-Alcoholic Whiskey 750ml,"This isn't a great whiskey alternative. There is more of a smokey flavor/scent (like a mezcal) than an aged barrel flavor/scent. I haven't had a chance to try it with a mezcal mocktail yet, so it might work okay for that.",More Like Mezcal Than Whiskey
Ritual Zero Proof Non-Alcoholic Whiskey 750ml,"The flavor is subtle, however the spices used to substitute the strong notes typically in a whiskey are too strong. The after taste lingers in the back of the throat. The smooth draw, which you find in most whiskeys and scotches, as well as the taste will never be replicated in a zero-proof substitute. And although the attempts at adding spices and the smoke flavor are noble, they fall incredibly and far short.",Whiskey Alternative
Ritual Zero Proof Non-Alcoholic Whiskey 750ml,"I read another review about it being too smokey, but I really wanted to give it a chance. The smoke flavor is very strong. The other subtler flavors are actually great, and it does have a nice 'burn' that makes it feel like alcohol. I would recommend using it more as a bitter than a mixer.",Almost A Decent Replacement
Ritual Zero Proof Non-Alcoholic Whiskey 750ml,"First-do not drink it straight, it even states that on the bottle! I miss the ritual of having a drink in the evening, and this helps satisfy that urge. I’ve made Kentucky Mules, Old Fashioneds, and others. No, it is not an exact replacement, but it does impart a sense, hint, of having a drink. If you, like I, can’t drink alcohol but miss having a drink, this is great. I’ve tried the Gin and Tequila as well. All 3, again, are good facsimiles, but not direct replacements. There is no better alternative on the market I have tried.",Do Not Use Straight Up
Ritual Zero Proof Non-Alcoholic Whiskey 750ml,"I was excited to try this and was very disappointed! The flavor is an overpowering liquid smoke and spicy black pepper. There was a group of 5 people and we tried it room temp, ice cold, mixed, and no amount of doctoring made it taste good! If you enjoy the taste of peppery liquid smoke, this is for you, but do not buy it thinking you are getting a whiskey substitute. I didn't try this expecting an exact substitute, but this didn't even come close!",Definitely Not A Replacement For Whiskey!

Michter'S US1 Rye Whiskey 750ml,"I wouldn’t have bought this bottle had I not visited the distillery and tried a dram. The rye whiskey I tried in the past had notes of leather and grass, which I am not a big fan of. But this bottle is exceptional, with no hint of leather and grass present. The flavors of vanilla, caramel and oak are well balanced, without dominating each another. On the nose I can smell Crème brûlée. The most expressive thing is that there’s no alcohol burn either on the nose or in palate. I guess that has something to do with lowering entry proof before aging. Finish is quite long for me with subtle sweetness.",Between Bourbon And Rye Whiskey

I was expecting more in the way of caraway or dill notes, but they aren't really there. It is an easy drinker, and could be a good introduction to rye if you're not sure you want to chance a really aggressive one. If I could have given 3 and a half stars, I would have.

Michter'S US1 Rye Whiskey 750ml,"I really like Michter's products. I've had their bourbon which is really solid and sour-mash whiskey. On the nose I get the brown sugar and oak, similiar to Maker's Mark but with a bit of spiciness on the end. It really doesn't even smell like your traditional ryes like Bulleit or Rittenhouse. On the taste you can really taste the oak and spice like most Rye Whiskey does but doesn't hurt you in any way. Not extremely complex but simple and I think I would like it on a warm humid day with some ice. In the future I would like to compare it to the 10 year Michter's Rye to see if the longer aging enchances the experience on the palate that I thought was lacking a bit.","Mellow, Easy Drinking Rye Whiskey"

The palate starts with dark baking chocolate, charred oak, vanilla, cracked pepper and ginger, intense dry peppery finish with deep charred oak, roasted walnuts and sweet buttered pastry.

I took a sip, and immediately noticed a smoothness that I'd never tasted in a rye. The finish is clean.

I even experimented by adding a little ""regular"" bourbon and that worked pretty well.

I've tried to drink this neat or on the ice for a few times, but recently I've been using it as my whiskey Highball base liquor. It performs well for that role, as the syrup taste has been diluted and become more pleasant. I imagine it could be a good base liquor for cocktail as well.",Best If Used In Highball Or Cocktail

Knob Creek Smoked Maple Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,"To me, it tastes like sucking a cheap brand of pancake syrup from the bottle. What a shame to ruin a batch of knob.",Wow
Knob Creek Smoked Maple Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,This is very sweet and taste like maple syrup. Its not bad but its not your typical Knob Creek either. This taste more like a liquor than whiskey. Its not an artificial flavor like some of the flavored whiskey's but is diffidently taste like maple. I could see using this in a whiskey cake or candied carrots at Thanksgiving.,Should Be Called Maple Syrup
Knob Creek Smoked Maple Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,"Some people think its maple syrup that is smoked?.......WRONG. This Bourbon is as smooth as 30 year old cognac ( I am avid drinker of Remy's XO), and just the right amount of smoke flavor, and lastly, a touch of maple.....as smooth as you can get, really.

Knob Creek Smoked Maple Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,"No, this is not pure bourbon. But it is without doubt the best bourbon based flavored whiskey available. the awesome smoked maple flavor adds another dimension to an already great classic bourbon.

Knob Creek Smoked Maple Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,"I really enjoy sipping Knob Creek bourbon, and the Smoked Maple variety is no exception! Great to sip neat or straight on the rocks.

Knob Creek Smoked Maple Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,"I am a bourbon lover, in all shapes and flavors. Jack has always been my standard. Bookers, makers, blantons... delicious.

Of Rye, along with 1 oz of a blend of vermouths to make THE BEST Manhattan's. I have trouble finding it in stores though (just stocked up recently).

Knob Creek Smoked Maple Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,Way too sugary i thought it would be knob creek with mild maple flavoring such as a smoked effect. it tastes like 1/2 maple syrup and 1/2 whiskey . I Cannot even give it away to any whiskey drinkers who like regular knob creek should advertise as syrup whiskey,Not Good
Knob Creek Smoked Maple Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,"My husband is a whiskey drinker and I have never liked the taste until he got a bottle of the knob creek maple whiskey for Christmas last year. He didn't care for the maple flavor but I love it! It's so smooth and tasty and it leaves a wonderful flavor on my lips. I just sip it straight, over ice.",Yummy
Knob Creek Smoked Maple Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,"Tastes like crispy pancakes cooked on a cast iron pan with bacon grease and covered in butter and maple syrup. I'm hoping they aged it with real maple or something like that and it's not just flavoring, only because it tastes real nice as a desert whiskey and I'd prefer it as an unadulterated whiskey rather than flavoring making it.. It'd be good in coffee, good in hot chocolate, great in an old fashioned if you leave out the sugar and put some cherry bitters in there. I have critiques about definitions and things like that. However, I still decided to give this beverage 5 out of 5 due to the simple facts that the taste is great, the fact that it's multi-dimensional and finishes nicely, it's 90 proof and smooth, it goes well on it's own and can make other beverages better, on top of the fact that the notes of Knob Creek flavor in and of itself aren't muted completely by the maple.",Like Buttered Pancakes.

Knob Creek Smoked Maple Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,"Ok ... the smoked maple was intriguing so I bought a bottle. Am a Knob Creek bourbon fan so I figured why not. I was surprised by how much I really enjoyed this bourbon. Not an everyday bourbon but very nice on a cold Ohio evening sitting in front of the fire sipping this finely made elixir. Sweet, yes, but not in a bad way. Still a bourbon with typical notes that can be expected. Makes an outstanding Manhattan. Try it ... I think you will be surprised as well.",Surprised!
Knob Creek Smoked Maple Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,"Bought a bottle because I love maple flavor and I love bourbon. However, I think the mixing of these two flavors does neither any justice. The first taste on the tongue was ""Wow, is this sweet!"", but in a bad way. I just could not get the expected bourbon taste notes even though I gave it several tries. I just can't get past the sweet taste. For me it's like drinking coffee; I drink mine black but when I get a cup that someone has added sugar I just want to spit it out. This is the same to me. My wife uses it for bourbon sauces.",Is This Really Bourbon?
Knob Creek Smoked Maple Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,I tried this in a sampler pack and HAD to get a bottle after finishing the little bottle. It does have a very strong aroma and the flavor matches it. If you love maple bacon or maple syrup on anything you will love this! I was still able to detect hints of other flavors even though the maple is strong. For a 90 proof liquor it is amazingly smooth and the aftertaste was pleasant. It is probably best as an after dinner sipper versus an every day drink. I'm going to experiment with different mixers and ice cream now that I have the 750ml bottle.,For Those Who Love Sweet.
Knob Creek Smoked Maple Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,"I introduced an Ohioan to bottle of TX and in return he pulled out a bottle of Knob Creek Smoked Maple. I avoided ""Epic Meal Time"" jokes since we had no bacon but go pancake. All of which was before I tasted it. The first aroma note is maple but there's still a good bourbon behind it. The taste was also a surprise because they did a good job of blending the sweet maple with the strength of the 90 proof bourbon. It won't be an every day drink but it definitely won a place on my shelf",Pleasant Surprise
Knob Creek Smoked Maple Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,"Just handling the bottle makes you smell like you're a waffle addict!

But on the palate it is very noticeably caramel, and so very smooth. A smokey finish that lingers but wouldn’t call quite call it a long finish. I bought this with the intent of comparing to Four Roses Small Batch because they’re similar priced and I drink a lot of the 4R. After having tasted it, though, it’s apples and oranges comparison.

Well I can tell you that this one has jumped up to the top 5 favorites of mine. WOW, this stuff is soooo smooth. A caramel woody and hint of vanilla but with that great bourbon flavor. Kinda smokey and a very pleasing aroma. No bitterness and so darn smooth. Goes down very easy and with a extremely mild warmth...not even a burn. This is a try sipping neat whiskey and I'm very impressed with it. One of the best I've ever had. I drink Redemption, JB Black, JB Devils cut, Black Velvet, and JB double oak and several others but this one just jumps right into my top 5.

Basil Hayden'S Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey 1.75l,The problem with Basil Hayden's for me is that it keeps me from trying other bourbons. Every time I reach for a nice looking $40 like Heaven's Door Tennessee Bourbon or heaven forbid a $50 bottle of something else I just can't do it. Basil Hayden's is so easy drinking (I drink it on the rocks) and so readily available and so inexpensive... my hand just changes direction.,I Keep Coming Back
Basil Hayden'S Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey 1.75l,"Received this as a holiday gift and I have heard many great things about it. I will start by saying that the Basil Hayden is a delicious bourbon; its not too oakey or too sweet but it just tastes like a classic well made bourbon. My only complaint is that it is a little thin on the palate. While the 40% ABV makes the Basil Hayden very smooth, it is definitely noticeably thin, especially off the heels of a 90-100 proof bourbon. On the bright side, while it may feel thinner in the mouth, it doesn't feel watery or muted in flavor. Overall a great bourbon and worthy of a 5/5, but at $40 a bottle, it's a little more than what I would want to pay for a daily drinking bourbon. If it were closer to $30, it would become my go-to recommendation for friends who were trying to get into whiskey/bourbon.",Great Bourbon!
Basil Hayden'S Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey 1.75l,"I don’t care if you’re drinking it neat, on the rocks, chasing, mixing, or taking shots. This is one of the best bourbons on the market.

Basil Hayden'S Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey 1.75l,I found this Bourbon while browsing on Total Wines app. I decided to try it based on all the good reviews from other people and the good rating from TW. This is one of the smoothest Bourbons I have ever tasted. I am very happy that I decided to give it a try. I even sent a message to my brother and a good friend who are both whiskey and bourbon enthusiasts like I am. I told them I liked it and that they should try it. I was surprised to find out that they had both already tried it several times and they both like it too. If you are trying to decide what to purchase I don't think you will be disappointed with this one. I enjoy drinking my whiskey on the rocks just because I always like a cold drink. I think you will enjoy this either neat or on the rocks.,One Of The Smoothest Bourbons I Have Ever Tasted.

Basil Hayden'S Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey 1.75l,"If I had this for a blind taste test, I would have guessed scotch, something like a Highland 12 or maybe Balvenie double wood. IS that a good thing or a bad thing? I don't know, but I did enjoy it. Its definitely mellow and a little thin on the finish. More floral, less sweet/caramelly. If you are looking for that traditional bourbon flavor with some kick, this probably isn't the one for you. LIke I said, it presented like a smooth 12 year old scotch and since I like both scotch and bourbon, and this is like a cheap entry point to a good scotch (the aforementioned being in the mid $45-$50 price range).",Is This Bourbon Or Scotch
Basil Hayden'S Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey 1.75l,This is an average bourbon at a too high price point. Anemic 40% ABV results in an overall flatness on the palate and quick finish. No age statement leads me to believe it's young. If you like Beam mash bills try Old Grand Dad 114. You won't be disappointed.,OK Bourbon With Training Wheels
Basil Hayden'S Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey 1.75l,"A very smooth & mellow bourbon whether you drink it neat, on the rocks or as a Manhattan, it has no bite and definitely the best bourbon I've ever tasted. If you try it, look no further.",Best Bourbon On The Market
Basil Hayden'S Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey 1.75l,"Make no mistake about it, Basil Hayden is a delicious Bourbon. Smooth, relatively complex and better than the sum of its somewhat watered down parts. Even at 40%, I enjoy the heck out of this. Objectively, it falls short because of being 0nly 40%. And that is not just about price/value relationship, it is also about shortchanging the whiskey and the customer on flavor. Basil Hayden can be made much better by doing one simple thing. And, the best thing is, you can do this yourself. Buy a bottle of Old Grandad 114. Exact same mash bill but different age and wood treatment. Mix 50-50 with Basil Hayden. I assure you, you will have a vastly superior whiskey. It comes in at 48.5%, so there is plenty of room to fine tune and open it up with water if you like. The character and flavor profile is the best of both worlds.","Great Whiskey, But 40% $40 Small Batch?"
Basil Hayden'S Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey 1.75l,I ordered this bourbon for a friend who resides in the other side of the state. The process was easy and fast.

Basil Hayden'S Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey 1.75l,"Don't waste this fine brown water on cocktails, Basil Hayden's is by far my favorite sipping whiskey. Doesn't need to be on the rocks just neat, in my humble opinion. Due to it only being 80 proof Basil Hayden's goes down smooth without much bite.

Not because it's a top-notch rare find, but that it is a quality bourbon at a decent price point that everyone has either already tasted or has seen the bottle and wants to try out. To that end, your guests may be inclined to give this a try and leave your more sought-after bottles alone. :-) This bourbon drinks more like a whiskey in that there is a pronounced and immediate initial spicy note and associated burn. However, the spiciness soon fades into a long, lingering, smooth finish that is desirable of a quality bourbon. So while there are definitely better bourbons out there, you won't regret adding this to your collection.",Good Entry-Level Bourbon
Basil Hayden'S Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey 1.75l,"Some people have labeled Basil Hayden as having a thin finish. I think it has more of a dry finish, like a good Cabernet Sauvignon. The first sip doesn't overwhelm the tongue. In the middle the normal notes of caramel, toffee, etc. are found. As stated earlier this bourbon seems to have a slightly spicy dry finish. For someone who is just migrating to bourbon this would be a good start to develop your palate.",Nice Dry Finish
Basil Hayden'S Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey 1.75l,"Before finding Basil Hayden, I didn't care for whiskey. It is much nicer than other whiskeys I've tried. Maybe this is the brand to turn non-whiskey lovers into whiskey lovers.",Excellent

Basil Hayden'S Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey 1.75l,"This is one of the first of this family I have tried but it will not be the last.

Basil Hayden'S Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey 1.75l,"Nose: Vanilla and Caramel Taste: Nose did not decieve, dominant vanilla, hint of caramel, sweet, slight spice Finish: Thin and Weak, mostly a lingering sweetness, not complex and rather short Overall: Can tell the recipe relationship to Old Grand Dad, but overall very mild compared to OGD Bonded, very smooth and soft, no rough edges, this is a very innocuous bourbon, and lacks complexity. My wife likes it with ginger ale… the extra aging did knock off the beam aftertaste. Not a good value at $35, but not a bad bourbon at all, My bottle was the 8yr, it has since gone to ""Artfully Aged""",Good Intro For Scotch Drinkers

Balcones Single Malt Whiskey Cask Strength Barrel Select 750ml,Not sure this is getting better but more likely my palette is maturing. The Balcones single malt consistently blows my mind. Recently had a chance to taste it at Whiskies of the World event in San Francisco up against 35 other distilleries and their best. Hands down Balcones won the night. This whiskey has the big broad shoulders of any American bourbon with all of the complexity of Scotch. The cask strength opens up for me with a single ice cube but that is likely more about my palette than the Balcones. Not enough good things to say here. Highly suggest you grab a bottle and discover for yourself. Cheers!!,Nominee: Best Of Show From The U.S.
Balcones Single Malt Whiskey Cask Strength Barrel Select 750ml,"This is an excellent, powerfully bold whiskey that drinks smoother than its high proof. It has a great, velvety mouthfeel, lots of brown sugar, cinnamon and oak on the nose, then a very unique roasted/charred/grilled corn taste, and loads of tangy stewed fruits on the palate, followed by a delicious, long, memorable finish of scorched brown sugar, toasted marshmallow, oak with vanilla, and plenty more of the trademark sweet, tangy prune/pear/plum flavors that just linger and linger in the best possible way. Win, win win. I grabbed 6 more bottles. It's the bigger brother of the already-delicious 106 proof Balcones single malt whiskey, being richer, bolder, sweeter, and darker, with more alcohol punch and more intense flavors. I'm not sure how you could pack more robust flavors than this into a bottle. Highly recommended.",Big Bold Rich Taste

I know, I thought it was too good to be true as well. I think Roe & Co. works in small batches, so ymmv, and it could be that current prices are low, get-acquainted lures to get the Americans hooked.

Wyoming Whiskey Bourbon 750ml,"I have been enjoying this Bourbon for the last month. Really enjoying ever sip. I really like trying smaller distilleries lately. This reminds me of Woodinville in a way. I heard that early batches of Wyoming Whiskey were hit and miss, but they got it down now. All the classic Bourbon profiles from start to finish. The proof is spot on for the flavors. I am leaving to Washington next week and I am traveling with a bottle of Bourbon (because taxes are 30% in Washington on liquor), I decided to take this bottle out of 20 bottles I have to choose from. Why? Because it's just a great drink, not complicated, not overwhelming, not a thinker. It's just an excellent dram.","Very Enjoyable, Support The Craft Guys!"

Wyoming Whiskey Bourbon 750ml,"This is a little known but great whiskey, made in a small town in Wyoming. Very unique. I was introduced by the bartender at the Occidental Hotel in Buffalo, WY.

Wyoming Whiskey Bourbon 750ml,"This is my personal whiskey that I always keep in the cabinet. It also a whiskey that I like to break out with friends. I was introduced to it while traveling through Cody, Wyoming. The clerk at the store where I was purchasing swore by it and she was 100% spot on. Very smooth, perfect in cocktails or neat. Won’t break the bank either. Pick up a bottle!!",Outstanding Whiskey

Wyoming Whiskey Bourbon 750ml,"Wyoming whiskey is my go to Bourbon. It has punch start with a smooth finish. I’ll drink it neat, a single large cube or sometimes with coke. It doesn’t matter how you drink it, because it delicious.

I don’t need to say anymore...all you have to do is try it, and WW will do the rest.",My Every Evening Bourbon...
Wyoming Whiskey Bourbon 750ml,"I was on vacation in Wyoming when I discovered this great bourbon. It's now my go-to whiskey when I'm not sure what people will like. Everyone that tries it loves it. They go out of their way to ask what it is. It's also my everyday bourbon. The only problem is Total Wine rarely ever has it in stock. I have to admit I had a couple batches that did have what I would call a slight 'essence of neoprene' flavor to them. But most don't. All whiskey's vary from batch to batch, so those 2 were just an anomaly.",Crowd Pleaser.

Wyoming Whiskey Bourbon 750ml,"After trying their Outryder whiskey I gave a bottle of their small batch bourbon a go. My bottle is from batch 44, flavor profiles might vary over time since it is a small batch bottling. This one for me was very fruity, cherries and orange peel and vanilla on the nose, palate is more spice driven with a fruity and oaky finish. Not getting the toffee and vanilla others have reported, for a non rye mash this is actually very spicy, reminds me of 4 Roses Single Barrel or other bourbons that have 20-30% rye. Yet this has zero rye in it. I like it! Would maybe be better at 92-100 proof instead of 88 but definitely going to keep an eye on future releases from this distillery.",Excellent Wheated Bourbon
Wyoming Whiskey Bourbon 750ml,Picked up a bottle of this recently. Had no expectations because I was unfamiliar with it. Was pleasantly surprised - it is my new favorite go-to. I respect and appreciate a distillery outside of Kentucky producing excellent bourbon whiskey.,Excellent Whiskey

Jim Beam Black Extra Aged Bourbon Whiskey 1.75l,"It just didn't do it for me. Even though skeptical of the ""World's Highest Rated"" on the label, I gave it a fair shake I think- 3 attempts over a long period of time- I have a pretty sizable collection anyway. It may be the best Jim Beam, and it isn't bad, it just isn't great and I wonder how in the world it got a 98 rating? It tastes like a Bourbon, but it's a bit thin after the initial spice/pepper. The vanilla was not as pronounced though there was a bit of a nougat-type flavor that comes through in some brands. Finish was ok, between smooth and tobacco-ish? It's fine, it's ok, but definitely unremarkable. Priced well enough for mixing, on par with Evan Williams or Old Forester. Sorry JB fans...",I Didn'T Get It.

Jim Beam Black Extra Aged Bourbon Whiskey 1.75l,"Just to clarify - this review is for the Extra Aged, No Aged Statement (NAS) version, NOT the original Double Aged, 8 Year Old bourbon. The Jim Beam distillery recently did away with the latter bourbon for reasons unknown (most likely to push their products out on the market quicker to meet ever-increasing demand). The nose for this bourbon is ostensibly classic Jim Beam, radiating gentle waves of vanilla and caramel with faint spices trailing not far behind. Although the body of this spirit is somewhat flat, it nonetheless harbors supple flavor notes of vanilla, toffee, black pepper, and sweet corn. The finish is smooth and slightly spicy, with a very minimal burn that's characteristic of an 86-proof bourbon. Although I would've liked to do a side-by-side comparison with this Extra Aged bourbon with the former Double Aged expression, it nevertheless satisfies as a cheaper alternative to premier brands such as Maker's Mark and Buffalo Trace. Suffice to say, Jim Beam Extra Aged won't bedazzle anyone, nor will it disappoint, as a solid sipping and mixing bourbon.","Replacement Of The Classic ""Double Aged"" Expression"
Jim Beam Black Extra Aged Bourbon Whiskey 1.75l,"After trying much more expensive bourbons like Angles Envy, Eagle Rare 10, Blanton's, Wild Turkey Spirit and others, my brother told me JB Black was his favorite.

Jim Beam Black Extra Aged Bourbon Whiskey 1.75l,"Not really 100% on JB Black. This isn't to say that it's a bad bourbon by any means. It's pretty good, in fact. I may have to purchase another bottle, just to give it a fair shot. I really don't have anything bad to say about it, but nothing overly amazing to say, either. Still, I would recommend this to people who like a little more oak in their bourbon. The charred oak comes through a little more, and it's slightly dry. Again, understand that I have no real complaints with this, it's just not something that really stands out to me.","Good, But Not Great"
Jim Beam Black Extra Aged Bourbon Whiskey 1.75l,"This is a very good bourbon, quite smooth, with a nice aroma, deep rich color denoting the proper aging. However, in a recent taste testing (neat of course) it didn't fair as well as Buffalo Trace, or Old Forrester, by a comfortable margin. JBB was on par with Bullet and Makers Mark. It's certinaly better than regular Jim Beam or JD, it's a solid bourbon, with few excuses. But I'd pick OF or BT over it.",Very Good Bourbon
Jim Beam Black Extra Aged Bourbon Whiskey 1.75l,"I was at a Beam event not more than 2 years ago with all of the Beam products available for tasting. Inevitably someone asked Beam's Master Distiller if he was on a deserted island and could take just one with him, which one would he take with him? Without hesitation he responded ""Black."" Black is smooth and complex. if you like a bourbon before bed or after dinner, this is it. I prefer all my bourbons neat but just a touch of water can open this one up nicely. I still drink Jim Beam White neat or with a cube, but the difference between 4 years and 8 years in a barrel is a very smooth, excellent, and a more polished bourbon. I don't really care the proof, a good bourbon is a good bourbon. Beam's small batch Knob Creek is just fine, but does not touch Black. I prefer it to Maker's Mark & Jack Daniels too.",An Excellent American Whiskey/ Bourbon And A Great Value

Clontarf Irish Whiskey Classic Blend 1.75l,Delivers all the traditional Irish blend flavors for $27 /1.75L. Unbeatable deal. I like it neat. Goes well with ice. Very smooth without harsh notes. Short finish. At least as good as major Irish brands. If looking for complexity and lingering finish skip this one.,Solid Budget Blend
Clontarf Irish Whiskey Classic Blend 1.75l,"I like my Irish whiskey room temperature, no ice, and Clontarf is better than Jameson, imho.",Smooooooth
Clontarf Irish Whiskey Classic Blend 1.75l,"I, too, had read that it was inexpensive and that the quality was not consistent. But the TotalWine rep insisted that it's what many Irish natives request. Well, I guess I got a good bottle! Quite happy with the subtle and sweet aroma, slight sweet bite, and clean warm finish. I went back to Clontarf before my Jameson (Don't hate me!)! Better than I expected (and I expected quite a bit)!",Highly Drinkable Straight!
Clontarf Irish Whiskey Classic Blend 1.75l,"Didn't expect much, because it's less expensive than other name brands. But let me say this is as good as any of the others. You won't be disappointed.",None Better
Clontarf Irish Whiskey Classic Blend 1.75l,"My absolute fave Irish whiskey, Distinctive flavor that tastes extremely well to me. Bushmills regular may be smoother (hard to beat Bushmills in that regard) but the Clontarf tastes better. Didn't have any harshness to me either. Stacks up well against much higher priced products. Redbreast 12-year, for example. Clontarf is much better for my money. Highest recommendation.",Excellent!

FEW Rye Whiskey 750ml,"The few was good but not great. A bit harsh and not the palate of great ryes, some of which are even less expensive than few. Not a bad rye, just not a great rye. We tried Gunslinger not expecting much and it was to our taste much better, more great flavors and actually smoother. For a not expensive rye try it. Our friends who are generally Irish Whiskey drinkers tried both at our home. They felt the same and actually between the two of them finished off our Gunslinger (1/2 the bottle) We still have FEW left.",Good But Not Great.

FEW Rye Whiskey 750ml,Put into this by a buddy in Chicago. Truly massive rye but totally drinkable and very little burn that you get with many other more standard products.

A bottle disappeared like magic in front of our eyes ... no complaints,Love This Rye

I like them all and give each 5 stars although each tastes differently. This despite all being 70 proof. I give the nod to Skrewball as my favorite, possibly because this was the brand that turned me on to peanut butter whiskey in the first place, but I think it is the sweetest by as slight margin. SQRRL has the most syrupy ""texture"" (most viscous?) and the alcohol was most forward in PB&W despite all being rated identically. If they were wines, I would say that SkatterBrain was the ""driest"" (least sweet?). The one thing I really could not determine was which tasted ""most of peanuts"" and I think it is between PB&W and SkatterBrain, but this was indetermined.",Four Way Pandemic Bout - Four Peanut Butter Whiske

But as for my taste Kessler is smooth and satisfying. Yeah, I've had many high-end whiskeys that my discriminating friends swear is the only whiskey they will allow to enter their system. Fine, enjoy your high end stuff, I LOVE Kessler at $15/1.75L .. can't beat it with a caveman's club! But yeah, I do also drink other mid to higher end sippin' whiskeys (single malt scotch/irish, Woodford, Bulleit, Col Taylor, Knob Creek) and other liquors (tequila, vodka, gin, grain/shine, etc), but for my daily shot or two, KESSLER is KING!!!",Great For The Past 25+ Years

Kessler Whiskey 1.75l,"Kessler really is as smooth as their slogan suggests. This is a blended whiskey, containing nearly three quarters neutral grain spirit, which means vodka. There is literally no difference between diluted neutral spirit and vodka. Don't write it off for this reason, though. It is still well worth trying, and blended whiskies can be as good as straight whiskies if done right. Kessler is lightly flavored due to the dilution and the predominant flavor is of a classic bourbon whiskey, but lighter and more easygoing. If you like bourbon, but the flavor can be a bit strong for you, or if you are looking for a more lightly flavored substitute for bourbon, Kessler is your answer. It is easy to drink, tasty, and inexpensive, and can be drunk neat, on ice, or in a mixed drink This would also be an excellent choice for a newcomer wanting to try bourbon or whiskey in general. It is very inoffensive and soft. I like Kessler but will probably stick to bourbon and single malt Scotch due to my preference of stronger flavors.","Smooth, Lightly Flavored."

A great alternative for when you want a whiskey, but not in the mood for a heavy-handed bourbon, or a rye.

Super smooth too. However, as with many recently well reviewed spirits--my last bottle was $24.99 and now I see TW has jumped the price up to $29.99...and at that price it only makes sense if you want to have something different around.

Bernheim Original Wheat Whiskey 750ml,I bought this a month ago and was disappointed with the wood spice flavors. Didn't taste like a typical wheater. Maybe it was their use of winter wheat in the mash bill that I didn't like. On to the next wheater...,"Not A ""True"" (To Taste At Least) Wheater"
Bernheim Original Wheat Whiskey 750ml,"I've had this bottle for years (gassed to keep it fresh) and revisited it today.

JP Wiser'S 18 Year Canadian Whiskey 750ml,Every Canadian blended I have ever tried as only been suitable as a mixer (sorry Canada!). Trying to find a good sipping Canadian whiskey has been impossible until now. Wiser's 18 is a top notch sipping whiskey and one you should try.

JP Wiser'S 18 Year Canadian Whiskey 750ml,"A complex Canadian whisky that offers more than your standard rye bottling. Spicy notes, christmas cake and walnuts covered in caramel, dry fruits, chestnuts roasting on an open fire, and the classic vanilla finish. Quite unique and best served neat or with some ice.

I like them all and give each 5 stars although each tastes differently. This despite all being 70 proof. I give the nod to Skrewball as my favorite, possibly because this was the brand that turned me on to peanut butter whiskey in the first place, but I think it is the sweetest by as slight margin. SQRRL has the most syrupy ""texture"" (most viscous?) and the alcohol was most forward in PB&W despite all being rated identically. If they were wines, I would say that SkatterBrain was the ""driest"" (least sweet?). The one thing I really could not determine was which tasted ""most of peanuts"" and I think it is between PB&W and SkatterBrain, but this was indetermined.",Four Way Pandemic Bout - Four Peanut Butter Whiske

I chose it because the bottle had a full seal but wasn't too fancy, no appealing picture, just a short description and a reasonable price, but not too low. When I cut the seal, I knew I made a good decision. There was no screw-off top, but instead, a cork. I just smiled and raised the bottle. There's nothing like a cold shot of good whiskey.

Kilbrin Blended Irish Whiskey 50ml,"Mellow whiskey. Vanilla, cream on the palate, moves to buttered toast and typical irish spice on the finish.

Kilbrin Blended Irish Whiskey 50ml,"I would say that this whiskey is light and approachable. It does however have a little more bite and a spicier finish than other budget irish whiskey I have had. The reason it only received a 3 from me is that it seems to be missing the buttery biscuit mid palate flavor that I expect from an Irish whiskey. It is overall sweet with tastes of fruit and vanilla and a little short bread. Smooth, sweet easy sipper with a slight spice finish. This is decent beginer Irish whiskey but not necessarily one I would keep on my shelf regularly. I would say for about 5 dollars more, budget Jameson is more complex and a better representation of Irish whiskey.",Simple And Easy.
Kilbrin Blended Irish Whiskey 50ml,Maybe it's just me but I found those whiskey pretty meh overall. First glass I poured over a stone smelled harsh. The first few sips I get the spice that lingers a bit and just a touch of vanilla that fades pretty quickly. Far smoother then I first thought it would be based on the smell.

Rogue Rolling Thunder Stout Whiskey 750ml,"I visited Rogue in Newport last year, while I was there I got to see their cooperage and distillery and was really impressed. That was the first time I tried the Rolling Thunder Whiskey, the stout shines through in a non obvious way, the only give away was the color. It's so dark and rich. The tasting notes are cocoa, toffee, dried cherry, a little smoke, and oak. I adore this whiskey.

Wyoming Whiskey Outryder 750ml,"This is good, but the price is a little high for what it is. It just didn't blow my socks off to merit spending $80 on a bottle. To me, it's a classic bourbon with a nice barrel char dryness on the finish. It's a nice balance of sweet, spicy, and bitter. Lovely to sip. I realize that small, craft distilleries must often charge more, but I'd like to see this in the $40 to $50 range. I would buy again at a lower price.",Good But Expensive
Wyoming Whiskey Outryder 750ml,"Its been awhile since I tried a truly challenging whiskey. This is one (and its a good thing). Some whiskeys are challenging because they represent an end member of a type or flavor profile, others because they are very complex and don't fit neatly* into a style. This is in the latter category. Not enough corn to be a bourbon, not enough rye to be a rye, hence ""straight american whiskey"". Normally I love complex whiskeys so I decided to give it a go The best way to describe this is that it is a rye-heavy rye-forward bourbon. Nose is wonderfully soft, with vanilla and floral and cereal, and for a bonded 100 proof the nose is very light and subtle. On the palate the ""wow"" starts happening. Starts warm with vanilla and ginger snaps, followed by a mini explosion of the rye baking spices, nutmeg, cinnamon, and then slides into a long finish with some oakiness and dryness with a hint of brown sugar and a touch of oily mouthfeel. Has a rye leftover mouthfeel after a few minutes. I would not trust most internet reviews of this whiskey (get the joke). The flavor profile is deep, finish is complex and long, and it is difficult to get a full sense of the spirit from just one tasting. This is a whiskey that will garner a bunch of 5 star ratings and a bunch of 2 star ratings. After a few sessions with this one, I have decided this is not exactly my thing, would not buy another bottle, but I am not going to hand off to the young guys at work either. Its a keeper, maybe to pair with some hoppy beer on occasion. I am giving this 5 stars for the skill and craft involved with this, others have tried and failed to do a bonded 50-50 rye and bourbon before, this one works though - maybe due to the malted barley they added into the mix, or the type of yeast they are using or the way that they are using two mash recipes. Doesn't land on my top shelf but for some people, this will be a home run especially if you like High West Bourye or spicy bourbons. Definitely got to keep an eye on upcoming releases from WW, some good distilling happening there. I have driven thru Kirby once in my whole life, cutting through Wind River Res to get to Sheridan. That is some big sky country out there, absolutely beautiful region of Wyoming.........",A Lot Going On Here For A 5 Year Aging

St George Single Malt Whiskey 750ml,"A friend turned me on to St George. I’m a Scotch snob, so the idea of drinking a whiskey made in Alameda CA was not on my radar. Now I only wish I had discovered it sooner so I could have stocked up. It is everything you want in a good Scotch. The nose, the taste, the finish is worthy of an 18 year old Speyside, but it’s young. They have created Scotland in California. You will enjoy sipping this whiskey. BUT, it is close to impossible to find. My friend was kind enough to send me a picture of him absconding with the last three bottles from another TotalWine store. I’m hoarding my last inch and refusing to drink it until the next release. Bottom line, 5 stars.","Buy It, If You Can Find It!!"

It's not bad whiskey but it might as well have been well whiskey in a dive bar. I love Rye - and two of my faves are at a lower price point than this ... they are complex with specific taste notes. THIS ... is one dimensional and very disappointing. Many of the reviews addressed mixed drinks, and I don't do mixed drinks ... again ... my bad ... I should have read the reviews instead of viewing the overall rating. 93 points from Wine Enthusiast ??? In my opinion that rating is not a blind tasting ... that's a business deal. Wine Enthusiast is not (in my opinion) reliable at all - it always seems that it's connected to the advertising. These reviews indicate they came from another source ... not Total Wine customers.

I've found that drinking over a large ice ball really opens up the bold flavor of the rye without watering it down too much, and it becomes something that I've enjoyed more than dozens of other whiskies I've tried. I would highly suggest it if you are looking.",Surprisingly Fantastic!

We took about 2 oz of Bulleit Whiskey, topped it off with Topo Chico sparkling water, mixed in a scoop of Trader Joe’s stevia and squeezed in the juice of half a lemon to make a healthy whiskey sour. Refreshing and tasty!",
Bulleit Rye Whiskey 750ml,"Pretty good. I’m either drinking this, Tullmore Dew, or Jameson for whiskey (in that order).",

Bulleit Rye Whiskey 750ml,"Really great budget whiskey! Very smooth finish, great for drinking straight or in a mixed drink like an old fashion. I would definitely recommend for the price to go for this brand over alternatives. I have recommended to friends and family!",
Bulleit Rye Whiskey 750ml,Taste is okay but not as good as some other more affordable rye whiskeys on the market. Will not actively support this brand anymore based on the ownership rejecting their own daughter from the family and brand due to being apart of the LGBTQ community. (Google Bulleit family feud).,
Bulleit Rye Whiskey 750ml,"Im not a huge bourbon fan, but I do prefer rye over other types because they are slightly hotter but a little more sweet.",
Bulleit Rye Whiskey 750ml,"This guy deserves to be treated with respect, no sodas or premixed cocktails for this guy. Enjoy him stiff, or with a sugar cube and fresh squeezed citrus. Whatever you decide to make, treat him with respect, and he’ll do the same back. Cheers!",

Bulleit Rye Whiskey 750ml,"For the price, it's one of the best whiskies on the market. When I feel like splurging a little bit, I always look towards Bulliet because it's smooth and flavorful and can be drank in many different ways.",
Bulleit Rye Whiskey 750ml,I have to admit that I dont really like that many whiskeys. They all seem too harsh and have to be mixed for me to tolerate. Everyone said this is a great brand. Taste like whiskey to me. If you like whiskey I would recommend my boyfriend loves it but if whiskey is not you cup of tea like mine I would pass.,
Bulleit Rye Whiskey 750ml,I really enjoyed this bourbon! It is really smooth and is perfect in an old fashion,
Bulleit Rye Whiskey 750ml,This bourbon is very good for making Old Fashioneds. Not my preference for sipping though. Price is very reasonable.,

Sheep Dog Peanut Butter Whiskey 750ml,"Nose: Sour cream, feeling like cup cake.  Palate: Very, very sweet, like stuffing a lot of licorice into the mouth! There's also some bitterness that could be from oak spice. The body is quite heavy, much resembling syrup.  Finish: The sweetness extends with some nutty and buttery note staying around. Pleasant.  Comment: This is a super sweet liquor that I don't recommend to drink by itself. However, I found it perfect to be poured on vanilla ice cream, making it a lush desert to have in summer evening.","Good Desert Liquor, But Too Sweet By Itself"

Fast forward, I'm nearing 40 and decided to give it another go. After my first neat glass, I said ""Great. I just wasted $75!"" It burned a lot. But the whole next day I had this nagging feeling like there was so much complexity to the drink, the flavors I was remembering, and I had to try it again. It was calling me. I have it another go and the next day, it felt wonderful. Granted I'm in blasphemous territory here, b/c I have to add a bit of water, but I'm thoroughly enjoying this Irish.

Redbreast 12 Yr Irish Whiskey 750ml,I am unable to drink beer due to a recent surgery. I can not drink carbination. So I have been experimenting with drinking whisky.

Redbreast 12 Yr Irish Whiskey 750ml,Regular purchase. Never disappointed. Smooth and satisfying.,Best Irish
Redbreast 12 Yr Irish Whiskey 750ml,"I've bartended for 24 years, but in Tennessee, so bourbon and Tennessee whisky dominate the bar scene. As I matured and my tastes turned to neat and rocks preparations, I took the tour of the whiskey world, but unfortunately all that graced my shelves around here were Jameson, Bushmills and Paddy's, if which the prior two were, hmm....drinkable, let's say. But Irish whiskey, to me anyway, was a bit like plain Jane woman, which is to say dependable, enjoyable, but nondescript. Then on a visit to the desert in Nevada, I stumbled (quite literally) into a pub which offered a Irish whiskey tasting flight. The lightbulb came on....finally. I've spent 8 years since sampling everything I can get my grubby paws on, and though there are more expensive whiskeys, Red Breast as the most character and nuance. It's just delightfully clean, while remaining distinctive. I've become an advocate for this whiskey on the local bar scene and everywhere I get it carried, it becomes a mainstay. I even made my scotch-loving boss (who frequently used to call Irish whiskey ""whiskey flavored vodka) a believer at work. For the mid range price point, you should definitely have a bottle in your cabinet. One good sized ice-cube is all that is required for perfect presentation.",It'Ll Make You A Believer
Redbreast 12 Yr Irish Whiskey 750ml,"I’ve never tried a whole lot of whiskeys, and have only been in awe of one which was a bourbon I tried in 1980- Old Weller 107. Last week I walked into an Irish bar and the bartender offered me a dram of a single pot Irish whiskey called 12 year red breast. I...was....stunned! I immediately went and bought a bottle and shared it with a friend who was equally in disbelief as are several more friends who have tried it. Smooth, no burn, light colored but satisfyingly flavorful. A special treat for yourself or a friend, you HAVE to try this fine whiskey!",Wonderful Special Treat!
Redbreast 12 Yr Irish Whiskey 750ml,It’s as good as it gets. My new favorite liquor. My friends agree with me. Wonderful spirit.,Amazing
Redbreast 12 Yr Irish Whiskey 750ml,This whiskey sits in that enviable sweet spot of great taste and affordability. Awe heck! Who doesn’t like a pricey whiskey to sip on as we celebrate the celebrate-able!? But for the everyday sipper? Give me a Redbreast 12. I always have one handy you know.,Sits In The Sweet Spot
Redbreast 12 Yr Irish Whiskey 750ml,"My favorite Irish whiskey to-date. Just pure, classic, meaty, sweet goodness. I used to think Green Spot was the bee's knees when it came to Irish single pot, but then I bought both and drank side-by-side. Not to disgrace the venerable Green Spot, but it's definitely lighter, fruitier, and, in my contemporary experience, simpler overall. Conversely, redbreast is more complex and meaty with a nice, sweet, lingering butter and biscuits finish. Honestly, if you think you like Irish whiskey at all, you MUST try Redbreast 12. In my book, it is THE gold standard for classic, enjoyable Irish whiskey. I enjoy many an Irish whiskey (Teeling can do no wrong), but... If I had to pick only ONE Irish whiskey to drink for the rest of my life, it would be an easy decision: Redbreast. The standard 12 would be fine, the cask strength even better. And I would die a happy man. If you don't believe me, pour yourself a wee dram of Jameson, Tullamore or even Powers... then, pour yourself a Redbreast 12. What you will experience will be akin to driving a Honda Accord, followed by driving a Porsche GT3. The good news? Unlike the Porsche, the Redbreast is only twice as expensive as the common folk's Irish life water. P.S. that said, choosing only one Scotch would be another matter.","Spoiler Alert: It'S Really, No... Reaallllyyyy Good."

Templeton Rye Whiskey 750ml,"I have sampled and purchased many of the iterations, and the 4 and 8 year batches are super.

Templeton Rye Whiskey 750ml,,
Templeton Rye Whiskey 750ml,"Templeton Rye is without a doubt one of the best tasting rye whiskey's you can get your hands on, and the more familiar your palate is with whiskey the more you will enjoy this seasoned rye. In fact if you are really looking to enjoy this whiskey and have a nice story to go along with it you should try youtubing the video on the history of Templeton Rye. A great story to go along with a great whiskey. I highly suggest it as it is one of those whiskey's that had to survive during the prohibition times so the history is very interesting. I rated this whiskey a 5* because honestly the taste and the value for the price is about as good as it gets for a rye whiskey. Now granted if 1/2 stars were an option I would have given this a 4.5 star because it isnt the absolute bes whiskey I have had. However, because 1/2 stars are not allowed I would definitely swing it in the direction of higher than lower. So there you have it.........Another honest whiskey review from Sippin with Shane.","The ""Good Stuff"" Is The Right Stuff!"

Templeton Rye Whiskey 750ml,"I now have approximately 23 bottles to my collection, and this one has now become my #1 ranked. First and foremost read the history on this whiskey. Very fascinating. Al Capone loved this whiskey, and so did the law (confiscating it at least). The owners of Templeton Rye had to secretly tie a horse to the front fence when a batch was ready. It was there only way on letting the locals know ""a batch is ready"". Incredible history and you can taste it in every sip. Smooth is an understatement, not a strong kick, yet not a foo foo whiskey. Just perfect for me!! By far the best of the rye's I have had so far. When I retire all I want is a few bottles of this and a view of the beach and I am in heaven. Don't worry about the $35-40 price. It is worth every dollar. True whiskey sanity in every sip.",From The History To The Taste......This Is The Real McCoy!!
Templeton Rye Whiskey 750ml,"This is simply one of the best Ryes around. Lot of history behind it, which makes it interesting.

For me, Templeton is clearly Snap & Scrunch. Was extremely disappointing, and so it's really strange to see all the other top notch reviews posted.

Kavanagh Irish Whiskey 1.75l,"Over the past couple of months, I've been trying new Irish whiskeys. I bought this one, in part, because of the reviews, but mainly because of the decent price. For me, Kavanagh Irish whiskey is thin and weak, and it is a solid zero in character. There just isn't any real... flavor. Now, some have applauded it for being ""smooth"". That's cool too. I've had, and enjoyed, very smooth whiskies that have character. This is different. If I were forced to use one single word to describe Kavanagh, that word would be ""meh"". Perhaps, as others have mentioned, Kavanagh is best suited for those new to the experience of whiskey, and that isn't to say that's a bad thing. We all started somewhere, and I'm betting it wasn't with Kilbeggan 18. For some, this may be excellent whiskey at a great price.

Kavanagh Irish Whiskey 1.75l,,Irish Whiskey Recommendation
Kavanagh Irish Whiskey 1.75l,"I may be a traitor but the sour, peaty taste of much Scotch, including the single malts, doesn't appeal to me. The sweeter, smoother Irish blends are more likely to loosen my tongue to spout inspired blarney and be a good friend to all. The Kavanagh is no exception, and I rate the 1.75 liter a BEST BUY - good neat or as a mixer, only 80 Proof but you won't find better for the price.","I'M SCOTTISH, BUT PREFER IRISH WHISKY"

Kavanagh Irish Whiskey 1.75l,Jameson is my go to. I was at store and thought would change it up and try something different. Not bad pretty sweet at first unlike most Irish whiskeys then mellows out. Very mellow and drinkable. I always drink neat with a beer on the side. If on a budget don't fret and get it. Giving it 4 stars for a great bargain wiskey.,Great Price Not Bad
Kavanagh Irish Whiskey 1.75l,"Saw the great price on this and decided to pass on my usual Jameson in favor of this. It's not the worst whiskey that I have tried but it is not very good either. Didn't really taste like an Irish at all to me, and fell way short of being as good as the regular Irish stuff like Jameson or Bushmill.",Stick With Your Regular Irish
Kavanagh Irish Whiskey 1.75l,"This is an amazing Irish whiskey, it's smooth, and delicious. Drinking it straight is alright, but mixing it with some Dr.Pepper really makes the flavor pop.

Kavanagh Irish Whiskey 1.75l,"My first visit to this store in Daly city and I'm impressed.

Kavanagh Irish Whiskey 1.75l,"I was told that this doesn't have the ""bite"" that traditional Irish whiskey has and I believe it. I like it far better. I love scotch, but find most Irish whiskey to harsh but with good flavor. This whiskey has a soft caramel nose to it.. it tastes of caramel, vanilla, and almost like cream? Also has almost a sweet quality to it. I think this would make an a perfect after sinner Whiskey do to its aroma and taste having the almost desert like flavors to it. This is not like the traditional Irish Whiskeys out there. If you want tranditional keep looking... but this is smooth and flavorful.","Good If You Don'T Like Whiskey With A ""Bite "" And Love Camel Notes"
Kavanagh Irish Whiskey 1.75l,"As an experienced bourbon and scotch drinker, I am not well versed in Irish whiskey offerings out there. For a smooth, great flavored, easy to sip whiskey, this is a go-to. No it doesn't have the taste of scotch (it's not supposed to) so don't expect that. Little bit sweet and a nice after taste (finish?). If you like good whiskies, try this.",Very Good Irish Whiskey
Kavanagh Irish Whiskey 1.75l,"Yes, one can spend a little to a lot more on other Irish Whiskeys but I challenge anyone to find a better value for the buck. I primarily am an Irish Whiskey drinker and I've consumed numerous brands available all over America and abroad. Kavanagh is an honest, non-pretentious, slightly sweet and very smooth whiskey.

Kavanagh Irish Whiskey 1.75l,"Starts with a malty honeysuckle sweetness, then a wisp of gun flint and coconut, fades into a lingering vanilla and oak finish. I bought this because the store was out of the Finnegans single malt I had been buying. This is quite similar, and very respectable for a single malt Irish.",Subtle Single
Kavanagh Irish Whiskey 1.75l,"Picked this up in Delaware. I am a fan of Jameson, Bushmills, etc and sometimes spring for more expensive stuff like Midleton. I prefer Irish but do like some Scotches like Macallan which I usually keep handy but they all seem to go so fast! Would like to drink Blue Label but can't all the time. When I had Kavanagh the first time, I thought it was very good... skeptical I tried it again, and shared it with others. Same reaction; very good. More and more I buy it and realize the price is right and will continue to buy. I expect this to go up in price but will enjoy in the meanwhile.",The Way Irish Whiskey Should Taste!

Kavanagh Irish Whiskey 1.75l,"A whiskey with nearly the character of Bush Black, but at half the price. If like me you find Bush 16 and Bush Black to be ideal, than you will find this to be a great ""everyday"" sipping whiskey.",Excellent Regular Sipping Wiskey

Teeling Single Grain Irish Whiskey 750ml,"Ok, I'll be honest, I'm a dedicated bourbon drinker. However, I've tried many Irish Whiskey's over the years and nothing compares to Teeling's Single Grain. It is by far the smoothest, less bitter Irish that I've ever tasted. Outstanding neat, too expensive to use as a mixer, use your Jameson's for that. - Don't get mixed up by their ""single grain"" and ""single malt"" when buying. The single grain is the way to go for great flavor and a smooth finish, but both are outstanding.",Best Irish Whiskey

Teeling Single Grain Irish Whiskey 750ml,"This whiskey won me over in Dublin, i quickly found the spots in dallas that serve it. so good. so easy to drink. knocks jameson out of the water.",BEST WHISKEY EVER
Teeling Single Grain Irish Whiskey 750ml,"Generally with Irish whiskeys you kind of know what to expect: kinda sweet, light, friendly, etc. This Teeling SG takes this concept of Irish whiskey to the extreme. My first impression was some shock at just how much this single grain embodies the light, sweet and friendly idea of Irish whiskey. I must say that, as an Irish whiskey fan, I was very pleased. If you appreciate a light, sweet, approachable Irish whiskey that won't offend anyone, then this is exactly that. I certainly do, even though I also appreciate a smokey Scotch, this is certainly not that... In fact, this is almost like a dessert whiskey. Don't get me wrong though, as it does still have some level of complexity and character, just not comparable to a heavy scotch or bourbon. Overall I recommend you pick this up if you're looking for an easy, sweet sipping whiskey, or if you're looking for the perfect whiskey to introduce non-whiskey drinkers to neat whiskey drinking (I'll bet your girlfriend/friends who don't normally sip on whiskey will like it). Doesn't need water, ice or anything else. Compared to other Irish staples, Teeling SG is sweeter and less complex than a redbreast 12, similarly smooth to Greenspot, but again, sweeter. Cheers!",Wow... Surprising.
Teeling Single Grain Irish Whiskey 750ml,An unexpected pleasure. One of the best. Took a bottle to a party broke it out while smoking cigars. The guys were taking pictures of the bottle so they could remember what they were drinking and go buy it.,Wow!

I give the nod to Skrewball as my favorite, possibly because this was the brand that turned me on to peanut butter whiskey in the first place, but I think it is the sweetest by as slight margin. SQRRL has the most syrupy ""texture"" (most viscous?) and the alcohol was most forward in PB&W despite all being rated identically. If they were wines, I would say that SkatterBrain was the ""driest"" (least sweet?). The one thing I really could not determine was which tasted ""most of peanuts"" and I think it is between PB&W and SkatterBrain, but this was indetermined.",Four Way Pandemic Bout - Four Peanut Butter Whiske

Skrewball Peanut Butter Whiskey 750ml,"I'm new to whiskey and so I can't speak to all the complex flavors and such that hard whiskey fans are looking for, but I can say that this whiskey is very smooth; probably because it is lower in ABV.

Tullamore Dew Irish Whiskey 1.75l,"One of the best all-around whiskies, it has something for all experience levels. If you're new to whiskey, this is a classic place to start since it has no alcohol legs, has tasting notes anyone can find and finishes well. It's a great whiskey to learn on and everyone I've shared it with can find the flavor notes. On the nose, it's rich but delicate: sweet with bread dough that opens to light caramel, very open and with floral notes. No alcohol smell. On the palate, fine: a touch of bread dough opens to fresh pear (both flesh and skin), floral notes, a little oak, and finishes with that light caramel. ZERO burn. The florals make it a super summer whiskey, but the pear and caramel notes make it a fine autumnal libation, too. It's great in coffee (esp your sweeter tea-like Kenyan and Ethiopian varietals), sips very well, pairs well with many cheeses and even works when enjoyed with a bowl of fresh fruit.",Like All Good Things Its What'S INSIDE That Counts

Tullamore Dew Irish Whiskey 1.75l,"I am a die-hard Jameson Whiskey fan, but to get it in a 1.75L bottle at a reasonable price I have to travel to NH to save on the taxes and catch a sale twice a year. The local BBQ place I was eating at ran out of Jameson so they offered me a Tullamore, I said sure, its Irish! I was immediately impressed by how smooth it was and tasty! I understand what people mean by the lack of complexity it has compared to Jameson though and I get it. But for the $35 price tag it helps me spread out my $40-$47 Jameson bottles and am quite satisfied as a (1) daily drinker. I only wish when I went to Ireland last spring we had stopped at the distillery when we drove by on the highway.","They Put The ""Oooo"" Back In ""Smooth""!"
Tullamore Dew Irish Whiskey 1.75l,It would be hard to find someone who does not enjoy this. Extremely smooth and sweeter than most Irish whiskeys.

Tullamore Dew Irish Whiskey 1.75l,"I bought a 1.75L of TD recently due to its being very cost-effective, and because I recalled Tullamore as being a very admirable budget Irish whiskey. While it's by no means bad, I must say that it is much less interesting than I remember. I don't know if it's Tullamore itself or, likely, my palate becoming more acquainted with good whiskeys carrying greater complexity. Either way, I have a hard time seriously recommending Tullamore Dew for anything more than a good mixing cocktail Irish Whiskey. For a few dollars more, I find Powers gold label to be much more interesting and flavorful... For a few dollars more than that, Teeling's small batch blows them both out of the water, in my humble opinion. I personally don't see myself reaching for my Tullamore Dew nearly as much as I was hoping I would at the price point, when for several dollars a bottle more I can have a much richer, more enjoyable experience elsewhere in Irish whiskey.",Not As Good As I Remember

Ends a bit more like other whiskies “on the rocks” but mind you that I am drinking it neat. I drink most of my whiskies with one or two cubes. It has a lot better finish drinking it NEAT.

The taste has no complexity or evolution while the nose is almost exclusively ethanol, and for a 40% whisky its a surprisingly harsh ethanol smell. I was given a pour for free, and that's the only circumstance in which I would ever recommend drinking this. I would rather drink Power's, Jameson Caskmates, or even Mellow Corn; all of them cost less and taste better.",Subpar At Best

Proper Twelve Irish Whiskey 1.75l,"So like most of you I read the reviews first and didnt know quite what to think. Were the bad reviews people who didnt like the whiskey? Or people that werent a fan of Connor? Since I am a whiskey collector with close to 85 bottles I thought I would buy this, add it to my collection and try it out for myself. Here is what I found...... I dont see the hype with the people rating this a 5* and I dont see they hype with the people bashing it and giving it a 1* quite honestly. The pop of the cork gives off a typical whiskey smell. Hints of vanilla are definitely apparent. Not quite tasting the honey others have referenced, but I do agree with a few other reviews that you could slightly compare the middle taste to Johnny Walker Black. That is a fair comparison. However, I will also agree with those that say that towards the end of the sip there is a strong alcohol taste that hits you that isnt like your normal whiskey taste. Now I wouldnt go deep like others and say it taste like battery acid or rubbing alcohol (That I believe is the Connor haters), but there is some truth to the ""odd"" taste. So where do I rank this? Certainly not a 5*, but definitely not the worst whiskey I have ever tasted (and I have tasted hundreds and hundreds). If you are a collector its worth having, if your looking for a cheap whiskey to have on your back burner its worth having (though there are others much better at this price) yet I also wouldnt throw the idea of having this bottle out as it is truly an ""AVERAGE"" whiskey. Not going to dazzle you, but for $21.00 what more do you expect? I love Connor, but can only say I ""like"" his whiskey. For that reason I give this whiskey a sincere 3* all day long. Too good to rate a 2 star yet nowhere near good enough to rate a 4 star. So there you have it folks. Another honest review from BOSTON SHANE",Here Is The Honest Truth About Proper Twelve

Irish whiskey is usually a safe bet, they're generally all drinkable. If not neat, fine as a mixer. It's the reason there's usually not a need for reviews. There just aren't any bad ones. Well that ends with Proper Twelve. My one star rating might seem harsh, as I've had plenty of American whisky that is far worse, but as far as Irish? There is none below this at any price. It burns like the most inexpensive bottom-shelf swill available and has a distinct aftertaste of isopropyl alcohol---rubbing alcohol.

Proper Twelve Irish Whiskey 1.75l,"Alright, look. Is it the worst thing I've ever tasted? No. But it's certainly far from great. Nose was almost nonexistent, maybe a little vanilla, a little sweetness. Felt very watery and light in the mouth. I got a lot of honey upon my first few sips, but there was something bitter undercutting it. It was like the taste of honey, but without the sweetness. I didn't really taste a whole lot of vanilla or oak. I'm sure its perfectly fine to mix with ginger ale or something sweet, and probably once you've had a few of those it might be palatable on the rocks with a splash of water.

Slane Irish Whiskey 750ml,"I’ve always seen this on the shelf but it never seemed interesting. That being said, it’s why I got a miniature just to give it a try. This is a triple cask blend with virgin oak, ex-bourbon, and Oloroso Sherry. The nose is young buttery caramel with bright red fruit sherry. A close comparison is funnel cake with strawberries and powdered sugar from the fair. The oak is faint and slightly green with faint baking spices. The palate is mildly flavored. It starts slightly spicy with acetone oak tanin and butterscotch. The Irish butter cream comes through on the mid palate and finish then falls off. Overall this whiskey is okay. There isn’t a lot going on and it’s very bitter and hot. It’s sorta like a cheap Redbreast.

I write a food and wine article every month for our in-house gazette (I live in a large retirement community.) We do a great deal of wine tasting. I had recently branched out from Scotch to Irish Whiskey. I decided to use the wine tasting techniques on whiskey. It was a great revelation to me to actually ""taste"" the whiskey as opposed to drinking it. I found that the Jameson actually had ""body"", something you always look for in wine. It also had a long finish. I compared this with my 8 yr old Canadian whiskey and realized that the Jameson had much more to offer. ""Sorry Canada.""",I'M 95% Scotch-Irish

Tried apple juice and apple cider, only to learn it ruined the taste of these as well. Leave this on the shelf. For the same price, go with Tullimore DEW or Jameson’s.

Proper Twelve Irish Whiskey 750ml,"So, bought it seeing 1000 commercials of it promoting they split a profit to first-responders. Bottle looks legit, fancier than my Scotches. I drank first one with two cubes; pretty mild; almost a watery finish. It has a sweet note that I enjoyed and at first, mistaked the weak finish as “smooth.” I am drinking one now NEAT; it has a typical “whisky nose burn”, taste sweet hints of vanilla for sure. Ends a bit more like other whiskies “on the rocks” but mind you that I am drinking it neat. I drink most of my whiskies with one or two cubes. It has a lot better finish drinking it NEAT. Worth a try. If you drink bourbon, it reminds me of “Ancient Age.” Lower end but as a mixer, I’ll bet its perfect.",Decent But Don’T See It In My Future

Proper Twelve Irish Whiskey 750ml,"For 25-30 dollars you can find plenty of solid whiskies, including some good Irish whiskies, this isn't one of them. The most prominent note to the smell and taste is ethanol with a vague hint of synthetic vanilla. The best way I can describe its taste is a mix of 80% rotgut vodka and 20% whisky with a drop of vanilla extract. The taste has no complexity or evolution while the nose is almost exclusively ethanol, and for a 40% whisky its a surprisingly harsh ethanol smell. I was given a pour for free, and that's the only circumstance in which I would ever recommend drinking this. I would rather drink Power's, Jameson Caskmates, or even Mellow Corn; all of them cost less and taste better.",Subpar At Best

Proper Twelve Irish Whiskey 750ml,"This is the only review I've ever written regarding Irish whiskey, but I thought I'd add my voice to the seemingly growing throng of people who feel ripped off with this one. Irish whiskey is usually a safe bet, they're generally all drinkable. If not neat, fine as a mixer. It's the reason there's usually not a need for reviews. There just aren't any bad ones. Well that ends with Proper Twelve. My one star rating might seem harsh, as I've had plenty of American whisky that is far worse, but as far as Irish? There is none below this at any price. It burns like the most inexpensive bottom-shelf swill available and has a distinct aftertaste of isopropyl alcohol---rubbing alcohol. If you're looking in this price point, 2 Gingers, Paddy's as well as the popular Jameson and Bushmills are all excellent. Avoid this Proper Twelve. Not recommended. At all.",Awful.
Proper Twelve Irish Whiskey 750ml,"I bought the 750 ml bottle as this would be the 1st time drinking it. Glad I did. The flavor is neither rich or smooth as advertised on the bottle. As a few have mentioned already, this does leave a rubbing alcohol after taste. That is not an exaggeration. Don't buy into the hype like did, purchase something else.",All Hype Only To Taste Like Rubbing Alcohol

Proper Twelve Irish Whiskey 750ml,"Perhaps this would be better to clean my shower or desk with than to drink. I have NO idea how ANYONE could call this a good whiskey. It's seriously like the ten dollar bottles you'd buy in college ... for thirty bucks. The only cool thing about this bottle is the bottle which looks like a hipsterized vintage 1920's bottle. Good looking on the shelf until you open it. Even mixing it with soda or ginger ale leaves a harsh and astringent taste. You could put sugar in gasoline and have a similar tasting product. Ever since Jay Z became a billionaire selling mediocre champagne and cognac, there's been a race to see what celebrity could make the most money by endorsing a liquor. Unfortunately the result is a bunch of gross, nasty junk. Anyone who argues that Tito's is a luxury vodka would probably enjoy proper 12. Anyone who doesn't drink jagermeister in shot form on a night out would find this Proper 12 offensive and terrible. Sorry, just calling it like I taste it. This is a chemical cash grab. Skip this and if you must get Jameson, Tullimore Dew or Glen Moray. Better yet, for around the same price grab some Glennfidich or Langevin.",Harsh Tasting Like A Cleaning Product

Proper Twelve Irish Whiskey 750ml,"So like most of you I read the reviews first and didnt know quite what to think. Were the bad reviews people who didnt like the whiskey? Or people that werent a fan of Connor? Since I am a whiskey collector with close to 85 bottles I thought I would buy this, add it to my collection and try it out for myself. Here is what I found...... I dont see the hype with the people rating this a 5* and I dont see they hype with the people bashing it and giving it a 1* quite honestly. The pop of the cork gives off a typical whiskey smell. Hints of vanilla are definitely apparent. Not quite tasting the honey others have referenced, but I do agree with a few other reviews that you could slightly compare the middle taste to Johnny Walker Black. That is a fair comparison. However, I will also agree with those that say that towards the end of the sip there is a strong alcohol taste that hits you that isnt like your normal whiskey taste. Now I wouldnt go deep like others and say it taste like battery acid or rubbing alcohol (That I believe is the Connor haters), but there is some truth to the ""odd"" taste. So where do I rank this? Certainly not a 5*, but definitely not the worst whiskey I have ever tasted (and I have tasted hundreds and hundreds). If you are a collector its worth having, if your looking for a cheap whiskey to have on your back burner its worth having (though there are others much better at this price) yet I also wouldnt throw the idea of having this bottle out as it is truly an ""AVERAGE"" whiskey. Not going to dazzle you, but for $21.00 what more do you expect? I love Connor, but can only say I ""like"" his whiskey. For that reason I give this whiskey a sincere 3* all day long. Too good to rate a 2 star yet nowhere near good enough to rate a 4 star. So there you have it folks. Another honest review from BOSTON SHANE",Here Is The Honest Truth About Proper Twelve

For the same price you can get a crown royale and not go wrong with it /",Ok Maybe Mediocre
Proper Twelve Irish Whiskey 750ml,"Alright, look. Is it the worst thing I've ever tasted? No. But it's certainly far from great. Nose was almost nonexistent, maybe a little vanilla, a little sweetness. Felt very watery and light in the mouth. I got a lot of honey upon my first few sips, but there was something bitter undercutting it. It was like the taste of honey, but without the sweetness. I didn't really taste a whole lot of vanilla or oak. I'm sure its perfectly fine to mix with ginger ale or something sweet, and probably once you've had a few of those it might be palatable on the rocks with a splash of water. But its just not strong enough to hold it's own neat",Meh
Proper Twelve Irish Whiskey 750ml,"As a connoisseur who has tried hundreds of whiskies from around the world(at all price ranges), this whiskey is singular in its approach and very one dimensional.

Jim Beam Devil'S Cut Bourbon Whiskey 1.75l,"I give Devil's Cut five ribbons for one reason. I am a scotch person. Smoky peaty sweetness. I have *never* liked bourbon. Flat notes dying mid-tongue, leaving me wondering why I had bothered. But a friend convinced me to try Devil's Cut. Confession: I have since purchased a bottle. Strong oak and - here I disagree with some reviews I have read - vanilla. Vanilla is a strong flavor; something we often fail to recognize because we use it so sparring and rightly so because it can overpower other flavors easily. The oak and vanilla make Devil's Cut delightfully - dare I write devilishly? - spicy. But there are soft notes at the edges of the tongue hinting a sweetness and a full range of flavors across the palate. I can't say bourbon will ever become my favorite, but any bourbon that could convince me to purchase a bottle deserves a 5/5 rating.",Surprise

Jim Beam Devil'S Cut Bourbon Whiskey 1.75l,"I've never was a fan of Jim Beam. Didn't care for the flavor. I visited the distillery once while in KY and tried the tasting. Still didn't care for the regular White Label Beam, but some of the more specialized blends and styles were nice. Finally went out today a picked up a bottle of Devil's Cut and I have to say it ranks up there with most of the highly quality bourbons I tend to like. It has a nice rich oakey flavor that I like in my bourbons with a hint of smokiness and sweetness combined. For my second glass tonight I added one small ice cube to help some of the alcohol evaporate. The result was a more flavorful bourbon with stronger tastes and smells of the oak. Have to say I'm a fan of it now and will continue to purchase it due to the exceptional taste and great price.",Excellent Choice

Jim Beam Devil'S Cut Bourbon Whiskey 1.75l,"I tried this Bourbon because I wanted a value priced spirit that was unique. Jim Beam did not disappoint. The process of extracting the dregs or the liquor that is trapped in the wood of the barrel with Jim beam's signature whiskey is revolutionary. What you get is a spicy oak finish that still has the characteristic sweetness of a Bourbon. This spirit comes off as harsh if you are expecting the traditional Bourbon smoothness. It is not an easy drinking spirit. If you don't mind the burn this bourbon delivers complexity, if you are strong enough to find it.",Worth A Try Well Worth The Price

Jim Beam Devil'S Cut Bourbon Whiskey 1.75l,"I'm a longtime Jim Beam fan for it's balanced tastiness. I regard it as a great ""around the house"" bourbon, great for mixing or just sipping. Bourbon is also my liquor of choice, something about the corn, rye, and limestone water, I'm guessing. I've sampled a few of the higher dollar bourbons when I've had the extra cash or opportunity and enjoy the different strengths, characters, and flavor profiles. I particularly like bourbons that go over 80 proof as does this one at 90. It approaches Knob Creek in body and flavor while matching Maker's Mark in strength. Bold without being overpowering. Good balance of rich corn and spicy rye. Bottom line: upper shelf bourbon for a more value price. Everything you like from Jim Beam with a satisfying edge. The devil wins this round!",Give The Devil His Due
Jim Beam Devil'S Cut Bourbon Whiskey 1.75l,"i tried this at the bourbon trail class in september. it was bitter, harsh, burns as it went down, and left a bad taste in my mouth. it took a lot of water to flush that bad taste out of my mouth. its not really that cheap, so i can't blame it on the price. we had 2 cheaper bourbons (watkins select and col. lee) at that class and they were many times better.",The Devil Can Keep It

Tullamore Dew Irish Whiskey 750ml,"One of the best all-around whiskies, it has something for all experience levels. If you're new to whiskey, this is a classic place to start since it has no alcohol legs, has tasting notes anyone can find and finishes well. It's a great whiskey to learn on and everyone I've shared it with can find the flavor notes. On the nose, it's rich but delicate: sweet with bread dough that opens to light caramel, very open and with floral notes. No alcohol smell. On the palate, fine: a touch of bread dough opens to fresh pear (both flesh and skin), floral notes, a little oak, and finishes with that light caramel. ZERO burn. The florals make it a super summer whiskey, but the pear and caramel notes make it a fine autumnal libation, too. It's great in coffee (esp your sweeter tea-like Kenyan and Ethiopian varietals), sips very well, pairs well with many cheeses and even works when enjoyed with a bowl of fresh fruit.",Like All Good Things Its What'S INSIDE That Counts

Tullamore Dew Irish Whiskey 750ml,"I am a die-hard Jameson Whiskey fan, but to get it in a 1.75L bottle at a reasonable price I have to travel to NH to save on the taxes and catch a sale twice a year. The local BBQ place I was eating at ran out of Jameson so they offered me a Tullamore, I said sure, its Irish! I was immediately impressed by how smooth it was and tasty! I understand what people mean by the lack of complexity it has compared to Jameson though and I get it. But for the $35 price tag it helps me spread out my $40-$47 Jameson bottles and am quite satisfied as a (1) daily drinker. I only wish when I went to Ireland last spring we had stopped at the distillery when we drove by on the highway.","They Put The ""Oooo"" Back In ""Smooth""!"

Tullamore Dew Irish Whiskey 750ml,"I bought a 1.75L of TD recently due to its being very cost-effective, and because I recalled Tullamore as being a very admirable budget Irish whiskey. While it's by no means bad, I must say that it is much less interesting than I remember. I don't know if it's Tullamore itself or, likely, my palate becoming more acquainted with good whiskeys carrying greater complexity. Either way, I have a hard time seriously recommending Tullamore Dew for anything more than a good mixing cocktail Irish Whiskey. For a few dollars more, I find Powers gold label to be much more interesting and flavorful... For a few dollars more than that, Teeling's small batch blows them both out of the water, in my humble opinion. I personally don't see myself reaching for my Tullamore Dew nearly as much as I was hoping I would at the price point, when for several dollars a bottle more I can have a much richer, more enjoyable experience elsewhere in Irish whiskey.",Not As Good As I Remember

Teeling Small Batch Irish Whiskey 750ml,Tracked this wonderful Irish whiskey down at the Bellevue store for my son-in-law. He couldn't find it in Oregon. He requested it and apparently it was a big hit. Store curbside pick up was so easy.,If You Love Irish Whiskey!
Teeling Small Batch Irish Whiskey 750ml,"Let me start off by saying my first love is Bourbon, followed by Islay Scotch and third Highland Scotch. So my knowledge and experience with Irish Whiskey is somewhat limited. However... This is the finest Irish Whiskey I’ve ever had. It’s got the typical Initial Butter flavor out of the gate. Then you get the very subtle ripened fruit flavor, from the Rum casts no doubt (specifically Apple & Cherry). Surprisingly complex and yet not overwhelming. This is just a pleasant, well rounded whiskey. This may have been my first bottle of Teeling, but it will not be my last.",Everything I Expected And A Few Things I Didn’T

Teeling Small Batch Irish Whiskey 750ml,Purchased this on a whim. Usually drink Redbreast or Knappogue Castle. Unbelievably smooth with rich aromas - and long appealing richness even when paired with ice. A bargain at this price! Would and will purchase again.,Wonderfully Surprised!

Teeling Small Batch Irish Whiskey 750ml,After discovering it more than a year ago it quickly became my favorite Irish sipping whiskey. I drink it with a bit of ice.,Very Nice
Teeling Small Batch Irish Whiskey 750ml,"I'm a pretty big fan of Irish whiskey. I generally don't expect a ton of complexity, but I can appreciate a nice, friendly dram fairly regularly. As such, I've gone through a good number of Irish whiskeys, from the cheaper blends to the richer single pot stills. I've also tried Teeling's full range, and I have to say that at around $30 or so, you really can't beat this small batch. It's both characteristically Irish; friendly, approachable, refreshing... but also much more complex, rich and in-your-face than anything else in the sub-$30 Irish whiskey category, in my experience. Next best thing would be Powers Gold, but for only a few dollars more (currently) I would recommend Teeling SB 9 times out of 10. Cheers to the Teelings! They seem to be able to do no wrong... And as an Irish fan it makes me very happy to see a small family-run Irish distillery taking such a bold stance in Irish whiskey and, in my opinion, truly paving the way for a revival of the richer, more interesting Irish drams of yore.","Best In Its Category, In My Opinion"
Teeling Small Batch Irish Whiskey 750ml,"Refreshing! Good companion to my favorite Scotch and Rye. Switch it up from heavy rye to light Irish. This fills the bill. Easy to drink, smooth finish.",Great End To The Day
Teeling Small Batch Irish Whiskey 750ml,"In my opinion---considering the price point, it's not bad...but, this really does lack the deep complexity or flavor of other competitors. For about the same amount---I'd rather get a Redbreast, or a Green Spot---both offer stronger flavor profiles. And if I look outside the Irish segment, I can do much better flavor and complexity at the same price in American bourbon (like a Buffalo Trace) or even some Scotish single malts like Benromach 10, the Indian Amrut, or for a bit more...best of the lot the Japanese Hibiki 12. It's not available yet in the US...but if it does come through, try instead the Teeling Single Grain...much better than this one.","Lacks Complexity, Can Get Better Value"
Teeling Small Batch Irish Whiskey 750ml,"Redbreast is one of my favorite Irish whiskeys and I feel Teeling compares very favourably to it. It is a lighter whiskey, but most Irish whiskeys are on the lighter side. An excellent value for the money.",I Love Redbreast
Teeling Small Batch Irish Whiskey 750ml,Mainly a rum drinker but also like a good Irish whiskey. Love the light rum influence that compliments the smooth and sweet nature of this small batch Irish whiskey.,Love The Light Rum Influence
Teeling Small Batch Irish Whiskey 750ml,"I have been on an Irish Whiskey binge lately. I gave this one a shot. Considering the price point, I guess I expected more. Light would be the key word in describing this. Light in color, light in aroma, light in taste and light in strength. Don't get me wrong, light is not always a bad thing. I guess I was expecting something with a bit more to it. I would rank this only slightly above a Jamesons or Bushmills in my taste. If I was to spend 40-50 bucks for an Irish Whiskey, I would not reach for this one again.",It'S OK
Teeling Small Batch Irish Whiskey 750ml,"Had this at a friend's house and it was awesome! Really a cut above most Irish Whiskey's I've had. This is a craft Irish unlike anything I've had. Beats Jameson, Bushmills, hands down. This is a craft, small-batch Irish Whiskey that delivers. Quality-to-cost is important, and this Irish Whiskey is in the $30 range, but well worth it!",Teeling Irish Whiskey

I give the nod to Skrewball as my favorite, possibly because this was the brand that turned me on to peanut butter whiskey in the first place, but I think it is the sweetest by as slight margin. SQRRL has the most syrupy ""texture"" (most viscous?) and the alcohol was most forward in PB&W despite all being rated identically. If they were wines, I would say that SkatterBrain was the ""driest"" (least sweet?). The one thing I really could not determine was which tasted ""most of peanuts"" and I think it is between PB&W and SkatterBrain, but this was indetermined.",Four Way Pandemic Bout - Four Peanut Butter Whiske

Malloye Irish Whiskey 1.75l,"I tried this Irish whiskey on the recommendation of a Total Wine sales associate who saw me eyeing another brand. I was told that I should stay away from the big name blends and give this single malt a try as it is “pure”. When I opened the bottle the only thing I found pure about it was the pure smell of alcohol. This whiskey isn’t terrible, but when you think Irish you think sweet and smooth. This is neither. It has an OK taste but the burn is ridiculous, both to the nose and the tongue it’s “pure” rubbing alcohol. I’m sure it would be OK as a mixer with ginger beer or with a bit of ice and water, but if you’re looking for a “single malt sipper” keep looking.",Not As Expected

Malloye Irish Whiskey 1.75l,"First: this is NOT Irish pot still style -- if you are looking for any Redbreast character, then keep looking. See the Wikipedia entry on ""single pot still whiskey"" for more. What THIS is, is a bargain in a balanced, slightly smoky, 3 year old single malt, made in Ireland instead of Scotland. Only single malt Scotches and other single malts make a valid comparison. This single malt is made in Ireland (by who, where?), aged in oak barrels (ex-Bourbon?) for at least 3 years (in Ireland or the US?), imported in bulk (barrel or tank?), and bottled in Princeton, MN by United States Distilled Products Company under the name Malloye Spirit Company. I think USDP made a significant mistake labeling it ""Pure Old Pot Still"", because it does nothing but mislead: it has no established meaning, is extremely similar to ""Pure Pot Still"" which does have an established meaning, and bears no relation to that established meaning. I suspect Wine Spectator was fooled into comparing it with the wrong style, and some of the high score might merely reflect a preference for the single malt style.","NOT Irish Pot Still Style, But Bargain Single Malt"

Wolfhound Irish Whiskey 750ml,"I did a side-by-side comparison of Wolfhound and Kilbrin. The Wolfhound is delicate as Total Wine describes its taste. I drank a mouthful of water first since some whiskeys “bloom” with a little water. The Wolfhound gives off a mild aroma with a very pleasant taste and it lands smooth on the palette. I would not mix this as its so delicate that I think its flavor could get lost, especially in coffee. For Irish coffee, I’m using the Kilbrin. They are like night and day from each other.

Ends a bit more like other whiskies “on the rocks” but mind you that I am drinking it neat. I drink most of my whiskies with one or two cubes. It has a lot better finish drinking it NEAT.

The most prominent note to the smell and taste is ethanol with a vague hint of synthetic vanilla. The best way I can describe its taste is a mix of 80% rotgut vodka and 20% whisky with a drop of vanilla extract. The taste has no complexity or evolution while the nose is almost exclusively ethanol, and for a 40% whisky its a surprisingly harsh ethanol smell. I was given a pour for free, and that's the only circumstance in which I would ever recommend drinking this.

Proper Twelve Irish Whiskey 1l,,
Proper Twelve Irish Whiskey 1l,"So like most of you I read the reviews first and didnt know quite what to think. Were the bad reviews people who didnt like the whiskey? Or people that werent a fan of Connor? Since I am a whiskey collector with close to 85 bottles I thought I would buy this, add it to my collection and try it out for myself. Here is what I found...... I dont see the hype with the people rating this a 5* and I dont see they hype with the people bashing it and giving it a 1* quite honestly. The pop of the cork gives off a typical whiskey smell. Hints of vanilla are definitely apparent. Not quite tasting the honey others have referenced, but I do agree with a few other reviews that you could slightly compare the middle taste to Johnny Walker Black. That is a fair comparison. However, I will also agree with those that say that towards the end of the sip there is a strong alcohol taste that hits you that isnt like your normal whiskey taste. Now I wouldnt go deep like others and say it taste like battery acid or rubbing alcohol (That I believe is the Connor haters), but there is some truth to the ""odd"" taste. So where do I rank this? Certainly not a 5*, but definitely not the worst whiskey I have ever tasted (and I have tasted hundreds and hundreds). If you are a collector its worth having, if your looking for a cheap whiskey to have on your back burner its worth having (though there are others much better at this price) yet I also wouldnt throw the idea of having this bottle out as it is truly an ""AVERAGE"" whiskey. Not going to dazzle you, but for $21.00 what more do you expect? I love Connor, but can only say I ""like"" his whiskey. For that reason I give this whiskey a sincere 3* all day long. Too good to rate a 2 star yet nowhere near good enough to rate a 4 star. So there you have it folks. Another honest review from BOSTON SHANE",Here Is The Honest Truth About Proper Twelve

Irish whiskey is usually a safe bet, they're generally all drinkable. If not neat, fine as a mixer. It's the reason there's usually not a need for reviews. There just aren't any bad ones. Well that ends with Proper Twelve. My one star rating might seem harsh, as I've had plenty of American whisky that is far worse, but as far as Irish? There is none below this at any price. It burns like the most inexpensive bottom-shelf swill available and has a distinct aftertaste of isopropyl alcohol---rubbing alcohol.

Proper Twelve Irish Whiskey 1l,"Alright, look. Is it the worst thing I've ever tasted? No. But it's certainly far from great. Nose was almost nonexistent, maybe a little vanilla, a little sweetness.

I didn't really taste a whole lot of vanilla or oak. I'm sure its perfectly fine to mix with ginger ale or something sweet, and probably once you've had a few of those it might be palatable on the rocks with a splash of water.

I like them all and give each 5 stars although each tastes differently. This despite all being 70 proof. I give the nod to Skrewball as my favorite, possibly because this was the brand that turned me on to peanut butter whiskey in the first place, but I think it is the sweetest by as slight margin. SQRRL has the most syrupy ""texture"" (most viscous?) and the alcohol was most forward in PB&W despite all being rated identically. If they were wines, I would say that SkatterBrain was the ""driest"" (least sweet?). The one thing I really could not determine was which tasted ""most of peanuts"" and I think it is between PB&W and SkatterBrain, but this was indetermined.",Four Way Pandemic Bout - Four Peanut Butter Whiske

Skrewball Peanut Butter Whiskey 200ml,"I was skeptical when I ordered Skrewball. I mean peanut butter whiskey? But OMG, it is amazing. It isn't sickening sweet like some other flavored whiskeys.

Skrewball Peanut Butter Whiskey 200ml,I really thought that I would taste more of the peanut butter flavor in the whiskey. It is not as smooth as I wanted either. I did use to make the peanut butter chocolate drink and that turned out better than expected.,Peanut Butter

I went back for more the very next day! I like bourbon & whisky drinks that are on the sweet side (like an Old Fashioned) Skrewball is deliciously subtle & slightly sweet.

Skrewball Peanut Butter Whiskey 200ml,"This is definitely not something I'd want to drink all day long as it is tastes very sweet, but I like to keep it in the freezer and have it as a dessert drink after dinner every now and then.

Skrewball Peanut Butter Whiskey 200ml,"I really like whiskey and peanut butter but never thought of putting the two together and probably never would have bought this on my own.

Skrewball Peanut Butter Whiskey 200ml,"I am fairly new to whiskeys and bourbon and I’ve only sampled a few dozen. This whiskey is the best I have had to date! I tend to prefer my selections to not have a strong burn or a lot of heat. And I enjoy whiskey and bourbon that has been infused with flavor. Skrewball PB is very smooth with just the right amount of sweetness. And the amount of heat is like a blanket to wrap you up on a cool evening in front of the fireplace. Perfect for a chilly evening! The aroma, taste, flavor, and the entire experience makes this a must have!",Skrewball PB IS A Must Have!
Skrewball Peanut Butter Whiskey 200ml,"First off, I recommend buying a 50ml for $2.99 and try it yourself. I like imaking a PB and Jelly shot.

Skrewball Peanut Butter Whiskey 200ml,"Had it in San Diego Diego because I have a love for both whiskey and peanut butter I had to try it. I know peanut butter and whiskey... what? And I thought the same but I promise it is awesome so smooth, sweet for sure but I drink it straight up. Sip it and enjoy it and I was so excited to see that the Total Wine in Myrtle Beach got it. It's so good I was willing to drive to Charleston, SC to snag some even for $38 a bottle. Fyi San Diego Diego $30/bottle so for $28 it's a steal!",So Smooth!
Skrewball Peanut Butter Whiskey 200ml,"I'm new to whiskey and so I can't speak to all the complex flavors and such that hard whiskey fans are looking for, but I can say that this whiskey is very smooth; probably because it is lower in ABV. The taste/smell is there, but it is a little too syrup-y and sweet. If it was a tad less sweet I think it'd be incredible. Definitely try it at your local TW before purchasing a whole bottle.",Great Idea That Needs Some Work; Too Sweet

High West Rye Whiskey Rendezvous 750ml,,
High West Rye Whiskey Rendezvous 750ml,"I worked my way up through the High West catalogue and finally decided it was time for the Rendezvous. High West has yet to dissapoint me so i felt fairly confident going in. I must say, i poured 4 glasses all over a single ice cube the first night and did enjoy myself but felt for my money I'd just as quickly reach for their double rye. Which speaks to me more. But on the second night i decided to spend more time sniffing and tasting and focusing on the flavor journey. That is why i said it is a challenging rye because it took me 2 nights to pinpoint certain flavors and for some reason it's always more enjoyable once i can pin down what's inside. Someone else nailed it in their review. I kept getting a grassy herb up front and it's GOTTA BE FENNEL! Fennel and some dill up front. I got the baking spices on the first night. The rye kick is hardly there and the finish is a bit burny in my stomach for some reason but all in all I'll say this one is nice if you wanna mix things up and try a pleasant but oddly layered rye",Challenging And Interesting

High West Rye Whiskey Rendezvous 750ml,This is the best Rye I had (compared to Whislepig too) — it’s has perfect balance of smooth and spice!,Best Rye
High West Rye Whiskey Rendezvous 750ml,"This is crazy stuff! 5/5 would and will buy again! Tasting notes: On the nose I get dill and fennel and sweet. Tasting it, it's fennel up front, and the finish has sweetness and mint (the mint is most obvious after a few seconds pass once its swallowed). How interesting! This one's really fun and complex. As I finish up my ounce, I'm struck by the faint sweetness left over. The complexity and clarity of the flavors and levels really work for me for some reason, but only if I have small amounts at a time in a glencairn (and it's totally wasted in a tumbler - found that I don't get any of the nose at all in even a small tumbler with this one). If I have a full dram, the nose gets overwhelmed with the alcohol, and the nose is too good to be wasted, so take small amounts at a time to really enjoy it.",So Strange And SO GOOD

High West Rye Whiskey Rendezvous 750ml,I bought this a month ago because of the age statements and the fact that this was supposed to be how the midwinters night dram started out. It piqued my interests but was then disappointed to find out that it is no longer made with a 6 year and a 16 year. Totally different taste then when it first came out it is not nearly as good as it used to be.,Misleading
High West Rye Whiskey Rendezvous 750ml,"I’m normally not a Rye guy. That said, a friend introduced me to this whiskey and I immediately fell in love with the bourbon-like profile. Other than the never ending baking spice finish, it wouldn’t be inconceivable to mistake this for a spicy bourbon. There is a prominence of caramel and honey on the nose and palate that perfectly balanced burnt earth and oak. One of my go to’s now.",Beautiful Whiskey
High West Rye Whiskey Rendezvous 750ml,"Let me preface by saying I love High West and the blending they do, it's amazing how they can blend such young whiskies and extract the depth of flavor that they do, its amazing. That being said, I had much higher hopes for this rye than what was delivered especially seeing it's a mix of higher aged ryes. I was hoping to get a lot more depth and richness, and sweetness from it and it just wasn't there for me. Funny enough, I actually prefer the double rye over this and it's half the price. Don't get me wrong this is a good well rounded Rye, but the reason for the 3 stars is it just does not justify the asking price. It has that typical rye flavor, vanilla, mint, toffee, and dill, but so do a lot of other ryes for less money. I would say if you want a good rye this is not a bad choice but if you're gonna spend the money try the double rye first or old forester rye or knob creek rye all of which are at least half the price.","Good, But Better Options For Lower Price."

Gold Bar Whiskey 750ml,"I love a good Gold Rush Cocktail, but it is challenging to find one that will not overpower the drink. Gold Bar's blend is perfect, with just the right amount of fruit and spice notes to make a cocktail pop. I'm sure it's from the whiskey resting in Napa Cab barrels before bottling. Gold Bar has a seriously cool package and it has serious whiskey (not cheap) to compliment the design. I love giving this brand as a gift too. I even have a mini on my desk for a paperweight.

This Black Reserve premium bottling is better still and well worth the extra small expense. Flavorful and smooth -- tastes better than some of the pricey single-malt Irish whiskies I've tried.

Kinsale BlackReserve Irish Whiskey 750ml,"I'm mostly a whisky purist. Scotch, bourbon more my thing with an occasional dabble into Irish. Not a huge Irish Whisky person so nice editions like Stout and Black Barrel editions tend to my speed when it comes to Irish. I decided to try this one for a few less bucks - so glad I did.

Kinsale BlackReserve Irish Whiskey 750ml,"I picked this up today instead of the Bushmills Black Bush. I liked the taste right away. Kind of a sweet vanilla taste with a nice finish.

Balcones Single Malt Whiskey 750ml,"I’m still a little bit of a novice with whiskeys and have stuck to bourbons for the most part. I opted to try this based on the flavor profile and reviews and was not disappointed. In fact, it was better than anticipated. It has a beautiful nose, with no hint of alcohol burn. It’s palate is well balanced, bold, sweet, a little spice, but not overpowering. It’s finish is what amazed me, where I was still tasting something akin to dark chocolate with burnt toffee minutes after finishing the sip. I would definitely recommend this and will be purchasing more down the road.",Amazing Surprise

Teeling Single Malt Irish Whiskey 750ml,"The nose is similar to a sherried Speyside scotch. Upfront is buttery strawberry funnel cake with lemon cake underneath followed with powdered sugar, toasted oak, and damp grass with morning fog. The palate is spicy fruit like dried chili mangos with dried blueberries and bitter oak. The mid is packed with baking spices like clove and allspice. The finish becomes silky with soapy sherry mustiness and lots of heat along with cocoa powdered almonds. Overall I like this whiskey. It comes across as a sweeter and less malty version Hibiki Harmony. This is a hard whiskey to judge. For 92 proof, this product is not better than Redbreast 12.",Very Preferential

Teeling Single Malt Irish Whiskey 750ml,"This is a great Irish single malt whiskey. The various wine cask influences really contribute to making this an interesting and tasty Irish whiskey. I typically prefer the greater complexity of Scotch, but if you're looking for a really quality, interesting take on Irish whiskey, I think you're hard-pressed to beat this for the price. Teeling has gotten me excited to see the potential of craft Irish whiskey going forward. To the guy who said he'd take Tullamore Dew over this, I'll happily trade you. I have a 1.75L of Tullamore Dew barely touched (really more for cocktails than anything)... In other words, I don't think it's even a comparison. Teeling is hands-down a better quality, better aged, better tasting and more complex whiskey by miles. Cheers!",Ireland'S Potential

Jim Beam Rye Whiskey 750ml,"Of the ryes I've tasted I've noticed that there are generally 2 types of rye whiskies: The lighter and more complex newer school ryes, or the rugged and rougher old school ryes. This one definitely is an old school rye, as the name says. Dry, hot, spicy, and a little rough, but yet has a smoothness, richness, and slight sweetness that is common to Jim Beam. It's not overly complex but is pretty straightforward. I appreciate the commitment to preserving this old style that goes back pre prohibition.

This is a good introduction to the rye family of whiskey. If you're looking for bolder more rustic flavors rye whiskey will deliver. Not as robust as George Dickel's rye but it is an inexpensive and interesting introduction to this type of whiskey!",Great Starting Point

10th Street Single Malt American Whiskey 750ml,"I'm so glad I stopped by their table at the last Scottish Games in Plesanton, CA. It was near the end of the event so I was a little skeptical getting my first bottle worrying that it wouldn't be as good as I thought it was after sampling dozens of other scotches. I can report that it's quite good. Definitely in a Islay style but NOT over-peated. Good oak notes, and a good balance of spice in the finish. A departure from my typical bottles and one that I think deserves a place in your cabinet.",Definitely In My Regular Rotation
10th Street Single Malt American Whiskey 750ml,"After reading some excellent reviews and being an avid Islay/Island peated single malt whisky lover, I just tried 10th Street peated Whisky and loved it! Surprisingly I like it as much as some of my favorite Islays, medium body and peat smooth with a nice long finish. It reminds me of Kilchoman Machir Bay or Ardbeg 10. Good value point too especially considering 10th St. has limited availability. I highly recommend it!",Excellent American Peated Single Malt Whisky

Punches above its 84 proof and, yes, I get the Stranahan's on both the nose and taste. Great value.",A Little Bit Of Stranahan'S Makes A Difference
Tincup American Whiskey 1.75l,"First was attracted by the unique packaging when I spotted TinCup in my local TotalWine store. I noticed it again as ""product placement"" in a TV show we were watching. Took a closer look during another TotalWine visit and I'm very glad I went for it. I love my whiskey and bourbon very much but find some of our favorite flavors in the more reasonably priced brands. Evan Willaims, in my opinion, is a solid choice too often over looked, for example. To the point, Tin Cup has a very approachable flavor profile. Very smooth, without an unpleasant bite and having a very enjoyable spicy finish, Tin Cup, served chilled but otherwise straight up, is a very enjoyable sipping experience. I'll even buy it again and I recommend you give it a try.",Tin Cup Is Silver Lable Good!
Tincup American Whiskey 1.75l,"Great flavor (touch spiciness from the rye, sweetness from the corn) even an almost orange like flavor note. Great for sipping or for mixing in cocktails. Makes a solid old fashioned.",One Of The Best American Whiskeys
Tincup American Whiskey 1.75l,"The next morning I still love this. It is full of surprising flavors straight out of the bottle. The rye in it keeps it smooth as silk, and the corn makes it sweet as candy. All mixed in with some interesting earth tones. This isn’t a whiskey drinkers whiskey. This is a whiskey for the people, the Everyman whiskey. Mix’s good 50/50, or 75/25 with coke. I would not recommend going high on the coke than the whiskey, because all hints that the whiskey is there would be lost.",The Next Morning...
Tincup American Whiskey 1.75l,"At 84 proof, has just a bit more octane than the 80's out there in its class. Still pretty smooth, but with just a slight kiss of alcohol to give it a bit more kick. Good, and pretty smooth.","Not Quite A Bourbon, But Has Some Kick"
Tincup American Whiskey 1.75l,"Very nice, rather light whiskey. I'm normally a bourbon drinker. This is a nice, light, crisp, and clean break from the bourbons. The taste is not as pronounced as a good bourbon or scotch but sometimes that is exactly what you want. This will be in my liquor cabinet for a long time as a nice alternative to the stronger spirits in my stash.","Nice, Light Whiskey"
Tincup American Whiskey 1.75l,"I enjoy discovering new whiskeys, I am an avid Scotch drinker who decided to try other whiskeys. I saw a full page ad for Tin Cup in the Whiskey Advocate, and I decided to try it. The first sip started a party in my mouth. I called my brother-in-law to tell him about Tin Cup, but he had already purchased it and he said that he was about to call me to tell me that he had found a new delicious whiskey named Tin Cup. I enjoy it neat or on-the-rocks.",A Whiskey Adventure
Tincup American Whiskey 1.75l,"Unlike other whiskey's, this has a smooth taste. You get a hint of smoke flavor and just enough bite that leaves you wanting more. Definitely one to have around when your best friends are visiting. Quality is very good for the price. Oh, you can drink this straight or on ice. You will not be disappointed.",Smooth To The Last Drop
Tincup American Whiskey 1.75l,I love exploring new brands and try to have 15 or more on hand at any one time. Once I discovered this - this is always in my cabinet. You won't find any/many in this price range that are nearly as good. All of my bourbon buddies are in total agreement. Very smooth - hint of butterscotch & light spice. Definitely an every day go to brand. You will definitely find more complex whiskey but have to jump $10 in price range to compare.,Nice Find!
Tincup American Whiskey 1.75l,"I bought Tin Cup on a chance. This is very smooth whiskey. I knocked one star off because the flavors although very good are not as intense as others in this price range. This is a good, mild and very smooth Whiskey. I enjoy Tin Cup neat.",Smooth And Clean

St George Baller Single Malt Whiskey 750ml,"I tried this an Irish pub that specializes in serving some of the best whiskeys and cognacs. What I had was a Japanese flight (Toki, Nikka Coffey malt, Suntory Hibiki limited, and this). Of all of them this was definitely in my own words ""funky"", not in a bad way more in a different way. To truly appreciate it you gotta have it with something Smokey and salty. Like one of the other reviews said ""it's not an everyday drinker"" it's a sit back and try to figure out what those flavors are kind of drink. It's pretty darn complex with a great smoke and subtle sweet.",Not For Everyone
St George Baller Single Malt Whiskey 750ml,"I read the previous review and was shocked! St George’s creativity really stands out in this “Japanese style” single malt. Baller Whiskey is exactly the kind of whiskey that I love and that keeps me in love with whiskey. While certainly not an everyday sort of whiskey, it does bring in a variety of flavors including the umami. Don’t drink this if you are a not open to expanding your pallet.",Better Than Expected
St George Baller Single Malt Whiskey 750ml,"Being a long-time lover of single malts and an American, I bought this really hoping I would like it. Brought it to a bottle-share tasting event with a couple of friends and on first sip we all individually decided it was without a doubt the worst malt whisky we have ever tried, and possibly the worst liquor of any category. After sipping some other whiskies I came back to it, thinking, ""It couldn't have been THAT bad."" - but it was. May use this as drain cleaner, but will certainly not be letting it touch my lips again. Buy this only if you want to see how bad a single malt can possibly be.",Horrible Stuff

My Fiancé really liked it and she hardly ever drinks whiskey of any kind. She actually asked for it to be stocked for her in the future. So that to me is a glowing recommendation.

Green Spot Irish Whiskey 750ml,"I used to work for an Irish company and was in Dublin for a couple of weeks. An Irish colleague had been particularly nice, and I was hunting for an appropriate thank-you gift. While in the pub at my hotel, I asked the bartender what bottle of whiskey an Irishman would appreciate most. That started a rather raucous discussion around the bar - with the guy next to me quieting the crowd by saying ""Green Spot - unless he's from the north, he'll be impressed to get Green Spot"". Turned out, the guy next to me was The Edge (U-2). I hadn't recognized him as he had gone from pony-tailed Edge to short-haired Edge at that time, but as a U-2 fan - his opinion carried more weight than it should have. So I found, purchased, and gave the colleague Green Spot, but never had a chance to try it. Well - I've finally tried it. I'm positive I'm influenced by the back story here - but I liked it a great deal. I expected a harsh burn - and was startled by the beautiful, steady, and a bit spicy finish. My favorite Irish Whiskey to-date has been Redbreast 15. This is right up there with that, IMO. It's not quite as full bodied, and rather than finishing with a long pull of spicy-toffee, it's more of a marzipan note that I get. But I love drinking it - neat or with a cube or two. If I want shocking power and in-your-face flavor - the last couple of drops of my Pappy's (20 yr) or a Willet Rye will be my choice. But if I want a complex yet comforting drink - Green Spot (or Redbreast 15) is where I go. Thanks for carrying it, Total Wine!",Came Highly Recommended ...

Green Spot Irish Whiskey 750ml,"I first had this whiskey in Ireland a little over a year ago, and am very excited that it's finally being distributed here. This brand has an amazing history and is still distilled at the Jameson Distillery in Middleton, Corke. This a a dangerously smooth whiskey with little peat and subtle hints of apple. I hope to see more of it along with the older brother Yellow Spot.

Green Spot Irish Whiskey 750ml,"As a single pot still in the $50 range, my first comparison is to Redbreast. I would say I was sorely disappointed; however, I could chalk some of that up to the hype surrounding this name.

Nobody else has noted this but, to me, has some peat undertones that make me think I'm drinking a mild scotch.",Not As Good As Redbreast

Something every whiskey hound should have just to say you have it, but I sure did expect a bit more prior to purchasing. I guess it was just a bit bland for me. Not really any bad notes or anything just didn't pop for me. I have had $20 bottles that have really surprised me with the great taste, but this was just ""so so"" for me. With that in mind your certainly not wasting your money by buying this. Just not going to blow you away.","I Don'T Regret Buying, But Not A ""Go To"" Brand."

It's what got me into Irish whiskeys in the first place (my favorite kind of whiskey), but Kilbrin 10 doesn't live up to they hype its bottle gives off. Instead of any chocolatey or minty finishes, it's finish reminds me (very strongly, I might add) of diesel, at least when mixing with Coke products. When by itself, it is deceptively rough, not at all like its original counterpart. It starts smooth for a few precious, sweet, flavorful moments, then attacks with what feels like pure, unmitigated alcohol.",Not As Good As It Seems

I sipped it from a snifter with a splash of water. Perhaps I should have mixed it with some Coke instead. All I can say is that it tastes artificial. The sweet and balanced flavor almost tastes like a syrup that was added to a poorly made whiskey. Nothing about this Irish whiskey is good.

I'm normally a bourbon guy but also enjoy a good Irish like Red Breast 12 yr. I'm regretting this purchase as the flavor profile is not my cup of tea.

This whiskey is very smooth for its relatively young age. It has a slightly sweet flavor with a pleasant amount of alcohol burn on the finish. It has decent legs and a silky mouthfeel.

Good for those nights when you get home from work and just want a quick stress reliever, but you don't want to pull out the $80.00 bottle. This is a great back up quarterback in my opinion. For the price you really cannot go wrong. Pick yourself up a bottle you won't regret the decision.","Another Review Said It Best..........""Satisfying"""
Kavanagh Single Malt Irish Whiskey 750ml,"This whiskey starts out with a malty honeysuckle sweetness, continues sweet in the middle, with a wisp of gun flint and coconut. Finishes long with a touch of vanilla, and a lingering bite of oak. I bought this because Total Wine no longer had the Finnegans 8 year single malt Irish that was a favorite of mine. This turned out to be an acceptable substitute. I'm curious to try the 12 year version of this whiskey, once this bottle is gone.",Satisfying Single

I pour onto a single small ice cube, in my rocks glass.. In the nose i got most of what's listed in the description- dusty cocoa, honey, clove, cinnamon. The pallet then brought everything from rye spice, to blackberry pie, crust and all! Even got grape, liquorice and a bit of rich oak. Nice rye spice with some heat and the finish is deep and smooth.

But then I poured the Rye and didn’t have any real expectations at all. It was so good, not at all what I was expecting. Just a little sweet, which I enjoy, and so much flavor. Nose: Peanut butter chocolate porter, Toasty Rye bread, Dark sweetness, molasses probably, Brown sugar, Vanilla Palate: Toasty, Thick, Full of flavor, Rye Spice, hint of mint, Salty, Dark fruits Finish: Lasts a bit, Medium, Mouthwatering (I want more) Dry but so pleasant, Oak on the end there I would say this holds up with Other Ryes close to this price or even higher priced ones.

Pikesville Rye Whiskey 110 Proof 750ml,"As a few others have stated here, this is basically Rittenhouse Rye at 5% higher alcohol and 2 more years in the barrel (six vs four). While a bit smoother-even with the higher proof-I just tasted them back to back and they are as similar as fraternal twins. I might have a hard time telling which is which in a blind tasting, if not for the slightly oakier and more smoky finish and more depth of nose on the Pikesville. Both are really excellent Ryes but for my money I'll save the $16 bucks and stick to Rittenhouse, which has 99% of the same flavor profile. Once you cross $40 there are a lot of interesting choices in Rye whiskey...",The Older And More Seasoned Brother Of Rittenhouse
Pikesville Rye Whiskey 110 Proof 750ml,"I bought this today based on reviews. Well, I am not sure why this is $50 @ bottle.

Perfect spice and tiny bit of burn. So good, I'm so glad the total wine people recommended it.","Wow This Is Good, Definetly Buy It"
Pikesville Rye Whiskey 110 Proof 750ml,"I found myself surprised at how this rye is very subtle on the palate but big on the nose. It's not that it doesn't have some nice flavor, it does; cherry notes, slight cinnamon, a small amount of smokey oak and clove. At 110 proof it is pretty well balanced to fight the burn it could have had. But the nose is really something, I put this in a glencairn and inhale mouth and nose after it's breathed in the glass neat for a few minutes. Really nice and enjoyable. Another thing to note: this is from heaven hill distillery which also makes Rittenhouse. If you want its big brother that has a 6 year age statement and at 110 proof check it out. I will state that while I really liked it it's not quite worth twice the amount Rittenhouse runs when you can get some really good rye's and bourbon for half the cost to $30",Rittenhouse'S Big Brother

Pikesville is Rittenhouse that is aged a couple extra years. The similarities are obvious. Pikesville is 110 proof so letting it breathe and a couple drops of water are not a bad idea.

I only get some sweetness upfront followed by a deeper, sharp spice and grain that is not very distinguishable or refined to me at least. It is not a bad drink by any means, but for the price point, there are much better options with more character: Sagamore Rye Double Oak, FEW, and even Piggyback(which is cheaper).

Jim Beam Honey Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,"I bought this as a liqueur (I wasn't expecting it to be high-quality bourbon), and to that end, it met expectations as a sweet and smooth drink. That said, I didn't pick up any specific honey flavors, so much as it was just generically sweet. I should note that I absolutely love the Jim Beam Vanilla, so my criticism here is limited to the overall flavor, and not the category of bourbon-based liqueurs in general (or Jim Beam more specifically). This does come in a mini bottle, so if you're not sure if it will be right for you, pick up one of those bottles for $2 and try it; I'd recommend a friend try it if they like this kind of liqueur simply because their tastes could differ from mine. I doubt I'll buy this again, but if someone offered me some, I wouldn't turn it down. I will definitely be getting another bottle of the vanilla as soon as mine is done.","Sweet, But No Specific Flavor"

Kikori Whiskey 750ml,"None of the 'usual suspects' are here. It doesn't look like whiskey (it's very pale), it doesn't smell like whiskey (very floral and melony), and it doesn't really taste like a whiskey (it's almost more like a wine to me). None of that matters though because it's a welcome change to what I usually experience in a 'whiskey'. There is the subtle hint of a very young whiskey flavor there but it's buried in the melon and floral flavors so it actually sort of works. Long story short I was not disappointed in this...it's a bit lacking in flavor compared to my favorite Scotch's but there is nothing bad to say either, and at a great price.",Unique Experience

Kikori Whiskey 750ml,Subtle aromatic smell. Very smooth on the palate. I had mine with a large ice cube. Hints of honey nuttiness and a little spice.,A Good Social Whiskey You Can Have With Your Lady.
Kikori Whiskey 750ml,"If your looking for the taste of Scotland, you won’t find it here. I love my 18+ Speyside, Highland & Islay Scotch, but I have many friends who won’t sip a drop. But, when I serve Kikori, they gladly ask for more. It sips nicely with a few cubes of ice. I’m thinking that rice is going to be a great way to introduce newbies to the world of whiskey. Note, I’m not trying to confuse people by using flowery descriptors to describe th nose and taste. I want you to discover your own garden on your palate.","Not A Scotch, But Very Enjoyable And Drinkable By"

Kikori Whiskey 750ml,,
Kikori Whiskey 750ml,"This isn’t a horrible dram but it’s not meant to be served neat. Stuff like Suntory Toki and this are great for cocktails even though the Toki is better than people give it credit for.. Nonetheless, this is a young dram on the nose. Heavy rice notes appear on the nose with bubblegum and syrup. The sherry is barely there and the French oak doesn’t pack much spiciness. It’s pretty watered down on palate but has a smooth finish. Probably an 80/100. A decent dram but pretty boring. I’m not a grain fan so I might be pretty harsh on it but it’s not for everyone.",Decent
Kikori Whiskey 750ml,"This really should not be labeled a scotch. I’m by no means a scotch expert, but this is a 100% rice whiskey, more comparable to a liquor you might find in Laos than Scotland (or even the rest of Japan, for that matter). I’ve yet to try Shochu, the rice variety of which I suspect might make an interesting comparison, but I’m fond of sake and unflavored soju—I can gladly guzzle chum churum by the bottle. If you’re like me, and you enjoy rice alcohol, I strongly recommend giving this a try. As a whiskey, I don’t know what to say about it. A bourbon drinker primarily, I can’t help but think this stuff barely qualifies. Maybe aging in barrels would bring out more characteristics I associate with “whiskey”, but as it’s sold, this stuff is *young*. Like you might expect from a liquor-strength soju of sorts, I almost want to say it’s more reminiscent of vodka. The ethanol is very prominent for an 80 proof spirit, but the rice flavor follows with a familiar earthy, funky tang.","Interesting Product, Maybe Not For Everyone"
Kikori Whiskey 750ml,"I didn't know what to expect from a rice whisky. I didn't expect it to be as smooth as it was - especially since it's only a 3 year old. A nice sipper. Neat, of course.",Surprising Dram.
Kikori Whiskey 750ml,"This is a fantastically well-balanced whiskey. I like Highlands and Lowlands, bourbon, rye, Irish, and most things in-between. This, for me, somehow sits in a place between all of those... lighter and cleaner... and yet has it's own thing going on. Try it, if but only once, just so you know what it's about. It's special stuff, though not cheap. It is one of the few bottles I will always make sure I have stocked for the home bar. Cheers!",Love This Stuff.
Kikori Whiskey 750ml,Picked this up on a whim after reading an article about it and was pleasantly surprised given the price point.

Kikori Whiskey 750ml,"A good friend and spirits aficionado brought by a bottle last evening. We poured into chilled glasses with one rock each. Love at first sip for both of us. We sipped through three long servings. We then switched to J.W. Black, which tasted very smokey in comparison, and we like Black in the affordable range of Scotches. Canadian and Irish favorites taste a bit heavy after sipping Kikori. Thus, in our opinion, Kikori (our only experience with Japanese whiskies) stands alone and unique among whiskies. Therefore, when the mood for light, clear, and tasty hits, sip the Kikori.",Smooth - Arigato!

If you have tried and liked any of those, I would highly recommend this Baby Blue.","Sweet, Delicious, Complex"
Balcones Baby Blue Whiskey 750ml,"I had high hopes with the blue corn separating this from other corn whiskeys, but was disappointed for the price point. The whiskey both noses and tastes immature and slightly raw. There is a consistent burn mid-tongue throughout the sip that lasts through the finish. It does taste different from other whiskeys, which I can only assume is due to the blue corn varietal, but to me it was really just a one-note sweetness that lacked any other discernible flavor profiles layered into it. Will be relegated as a mixing whiskey as this is not something I enjoyed neat or with an ice cube.",Lacks Depth

Balcones Baby Blue Whiskey 750ml,"I bought this because it was all corn or mostly corn whiskey, just like Mellow Corn, thinking it would be a change of pace from the traditional bourbon we all like. Well it is different just like Mellow corn they both are more astringent and drink a little hotter than the proof would indicate. But I tell you when I mixed this with Old Grand Dad 114, 1 oz. each, it came alive. Peppermint candy cane on the tongue all day long for me. It was surprising and very pleasant all at once. I'm going to try and mix these high corn whiskeys with other traditional bourbons and see what other flavors I can dig up ;-)",Mix This With Something
Balcones Baby Blue Whiskey 750ml,"I’m sure this “bourbon” has a spot in some people’s shelves. I admit... the blue corn was intriguing. I have never thrown out a glass of bourbon, or rye until I tried this one. It doesn’t taste like a typical bourbon whatsoever. It’s hard to describe, but I kept imagining some combo of vinegar and corn. It’s unique no doubt, but not for people who like traditional bourbon profiles (caramel, vanilla, dark/stone fruits, oak, etc.).",Buyer Beware

Balcones Baby Blue Whiskey 750ml,"While at the liquor store, I've seen this several times at BevMo and Total Wine. I'm not a huge craft whiskey kind of guy, I'm a bourbon fanatic and I like it strong and brown. But being from Texas my home state, and it was baby blue corn, I said why not try it. I paid around 40 bucks for it and got home and opened the bottle. This whiskey reminded me of a very immature scotch. It has a very sweet nose, the pallet is kind of confusing. You're getting a lot of different flavors like a scotch, sweet, smoky, a little spice. Overall, it's a very immature whiskey with very much promise. However it needs to be matured longer, maybe some more wood needs to interact with the whiskey and overall, it needs to be more balanced. Overall at best a three-star whiskey. Texas I know you can do better, so bring it.",A Good Idea Executed Poorly

Balcones Baby Blue Whiskey 750ml,Wow! I really didn't expect to like this as much as I did. I get the feeling this is a pretty young whiskey. It's got a flavor like nothing else.

This is a hard to find bottle in the Pacific Northwest. Really makes me wonder what the other Balcones whiskies taste like.,You'Re Going To Have To Beat Me To This One!
Balcones Baby Blue Whiskey 750ml,"New whisky companies spring up like the corn from which they're often distilled. Baby Blue is a blue corn whisky, a grain well known in Texas and New Mexico for pretty and sweetly nutty tortilla chips and stacked blue corn chicken enchiladas. Master distiller Chip Tate took that nutty sweetness into one of the finest whiskeys to be produced West of the Mississippi. Truly I love the taste because it's so unique. Unfortunately to get bigger, Balcones took on partners and Chip is no longer there after a well-publicized spat that was featured in the NYTimes a couple of weeks back. I hope that the future bottlings under its new creative people maintain that quality, but I have enough to last me a while. I also hope Chip returns to the whiskey scene once his non-compete ends.

Redemption Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,The price was good and the flavor was good and surprisingly smooth for the price. Will definitely buy again when trying not to break the bank,Great Deal
Redemption Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,"This whiskey would be a decent low-mid bourbon if it wasn't for its hefty price tag. Sure, it isn't burning your wallet, but the quality you're getting is comparable to the $15 bargain bin—not that there's anything wrong with the bargain bin. The nose is caramelly, with that characteristic sharp, spicy bourbon rye followed by smooth sweet finish. The problem is that it might be a little TOO smooth; the spice, while soft, is still enough to mask a lot of its already-mild flavors. Its classic corn and oaky flavors don't linger as much as you would want from a sipping bourbon. If I was served it at another person's house, I'd be satisfied. Would I go out of my way to buy it again for myself? Probably not.","Easy Sip, But A Bit Expensive For Its Thinness"

Redemption Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,"Redemption Bourbon compares favorably with much more pricey and longer aged whiskey. Amazingly, aging for 10-20 years is no longer required for premium taste.

Redemption Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,"This bourbon is similar in age, proof and mash bill to Old Forester 86. I really like OF 86, but I like Redemption much more. Smoother, better nose and taste. The one downside is the price; it does cost 50% more than OF 86. If you like OF 86 or a similar rye bourbon, I suggest comparing both for yourself to see if it's worth the premium.

Once I finished that, went back to this one and it is perfect for me. I’m a bourbon-cocktail person and not a technical reviewer like some of the others here, but I’m sold on this flavor. It’s just the right mix of spice/sweet/vanilla/caramel flavors.",Love It!
Redemption Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,"Check the 1 year age statement on the back. This stuff is a vile and dissatisfying.

Redemption Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,"Ive had Bulleit, Maker's Mark, MM46, Woodford, Elijah Craig, and Four Roses SB among others. This young and light colored whisky really took me by surprise. Yes it says on the bottle aged for a minimum of 1 year!, and I believe the oldest in the blend is 3 years, however don't let that scare you away. This young bourbon is so easy drinking I am definitely going to explore the rest of the Redemption lineup. I notice the requisite caramel and vanilla with a lovely spice , that I've only found previously in the aforementioned Four Roses and MM 46, but with none of the harsh bite towards the finish. You may be able to tell I don't drink bourbon super often bc I know some of you prefer and appreciate that strength, however I highly recommend this for beginner bourbon drinkers or those looking for one on the lighter side. Cheers!",Surprisingly Delicious
Redemption Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,"Sampled in store and thought that it was smooth but not very flavorful and did not leave much of a finish. Honestly doesn't pack more of a flavor punch than Evan Williams black label. At least Evan is a straight bourbon, which means it has to be at least 4 years (or have an age statement if under). This bourbon doesn't say straight or have an age statement, which means it could be aged for two months for all we know. Tastes very young, maybe 2-3 years at most. At this price range it's a huge ripoff. Figures that's what you get when you buy random bourbon from Indiana instead of good old Kentucky bourbon.",No Age Statement From A No-Name Distillery

Glendalough Double Barrel Whiskey 750ml,Bought this as an up sell to Jameson. By far more complex and tasteful. Take this over a blended Irish any day,Deliciously Smooth !
Glendalough Double Barrel Whiskey 750ml,"Purchased as a gift for myself. Just wanted to try a little something different other than Jamesons or Bushmill's from an Irish distiller - My preference between those two in past has been Jamesons - This Glendalough is closer to but sweeter than Jamesons -I was very happy with it - (Possibly the poor comment below by the ""windex guy"" may be a result of loss of taste and smell due to the effects of COVID19)-",A Friendly Smooth Whiskey
Glendalough Double Barrel Whiskey 750ml,Not really sure what the windex guy below is talking about he must not know anything about whiskey .. great entry whiskey which anybody can enjoy. On the sweeter side much like a bourbon with notes of cherry & apricot from the sherry finish. Best Irish whiskey for $30 on the market,Best Irish Whiskey

Midleton Barry Crockett Whiskey 750ml,"I love Middleton to begin with, but the Barry Crockett is superb. You get a taste of limes, mandarin orange, hints of vanilla and cinnamon, with a light pepperiness all bound up in a wonderfully smooth, yet fresh, sweetness. The oak does come though and all this flavor lasts into the finish quite wonderfully.",Midleton Barry Crockett Is Wonderful!
Midleton Barry Crockett Whiskey 750ml,Rare opportunity to have this incredible Irish Whiskey,Excellent
Midleton Barry Crockett Whiskey 750ml,"I always had Midleton Very Rare, which was out of stock, so I tried Midleton Barry Crockett, but it was not as smooth as Midleton Very Rare, hence 4 stars.

Midleton Barry Crockett Whiskey 750ml,Top notch Irish Whiskey! Very smooth and very much worth the money. Considering you can't really purchase this many places in the US it's a taste of something special from Ireland.,Top Notch
Midleton Barry Crockett Whiskey 750ml,"I am in agreement with the other reviewer, however, as I am also a bourbon lover I have to give this a solid 5 stars. When I compare this to traditional Irish Whiskey, I don't get that distinct profile that comes with Redbreast 15/21/Cask or Teeling's Small/Special's, or even Power's. With that said, the taste profile is almost a mix of this with some vanilla and caramel, with a similar Blanton's kind of profile to the nose and that initial tongue warming burn from a strong bourbon (which I don't get in Irish Whiskey's). I for one am pleased with this product, it is hard to classify it as Irish Whiskey though, it just comes from Ireland, that said, I would have no hesitation of getting another bottle to store in the cabinet.",Extremely Smooth - Not Irish Tasting?
Midleton Barry Crockett Whiskey 750ml,"As a lover of Irish Whiskey, I looked forward to trying this at the WhiskyFest in Chicago this year. I left disappointed in it. It lacked the Irish character that I was looking for. If you're a fan of Pot Still Irish Whiskey, splurge on the RedBreast 21 for a little bit more. I'm not a Bourbon fan, but think this would appeal to Bourbon lovers.",Irish For Bourbon Lovers

Kavanagh Bordeaux Red Wine Cask Irish Whiskey 750ml,"Not good unless you like the taste of sawdust or the inside of an oak barrel. Either hyper marketing on this whiskey or my poor taste. Maybe it will grow on me, I drink it neat with a drop of water. Stick with Kavanagh's regular blend, it's smooth and costs much less. If you want a top notch Irish try Redbreast 12 year or go to Ireland and buy Jameson's Crested","Not Good, Unless...."

Mellow Corn Whiskey 750ml,"If you can get past the garish yellow label, this whiskey is delightful. At 50% ABV (BiB), a wee bit of water helps. Over ice if you must. Surprisingly, the corn notes are not as pronounced as one might expect. I've heard some online reviewers say the taste is nothing but corn, but those same reviewers claim the whiskey is weak because of its lighter color. Have they never heard of E150a caramel? I highly doubt Mellow Corn has any. Anyway, Heaven Hill does a fine job on their products and Mellow Corn is no exception. I enjoy it for sipping, but I imagine it would be perfectly satisfactory in mixed drinks. At its price point, there's no risk in giving it a try.",A Surprising Bottom-Shelf Whiskey
Mellow Corn Whiskey 750ml,"I really enjoyed tasting the difference of this compared to some other corn based spirits. I probably would have given five stars but heard maybe too much hype before tasting. With Mellow in the name, I was hoping for smoother. I prefer lower proof and aged. Heaven Hill gives a recipe with Canton (a huge favorite) and grapefruit juice that was simply beautiful, light and refreshing. Golden Derby, I believe. I would absolutely serve that at parties. Not my every day, but well worth having for something different in the liquor cabinet. They have a great podcast about it as well.",Makes A Great Cocktail

Mellow Corn Whiskey 750ml,"It's not bad, but it's nothing spectacular either. It's sweet on the nose...I get the brown sugar and vanilla notes with a hint of corn husk. the palate on the other hand, is a different story. it's dry, spicy, and very little sweetness to it...mostly bitter to be honest. the best part of the experience though, comes about 30-40 seconds after tasting it. you get a very strong note of what I can only describe as the cob part of corn, as if you just finished eating a corn on the cob and are trying to get all the juices out of the cob...very interesting finish. Would I buy this again? probably not, but it is worth experiencing this whiskey if you haven't before. For the price it's worth buying. if it where more than say 25 dollars, I'd say look at other options.",A Whiskey Worth Experiencing Once.
Mellow Corn Whiskey 750ml,"I mostly stopped reviewing because I tired of everybody buying what I like to the point that I can't get it any more. But this one I feel safe. It is literally Bourbon: at least 51% corn, aged in unused charred American oak barrels, at least 2 years. This one is 100% corn, aged 4 years, bottled at 100 proof. You can't like moonshine and not like this, moonshine to the next level. For cocktails, no other Bourbon comes close. All it lacks of more expensive Bourbons are the minority grain notes and additional age smoothness, the things worth paying more for.",Rare Bourbon Value
Mellow Corn Whiskey 750ml,"This isn’t just affordable, it’s UNIQUE. It’s not bourbon, so there’s no point in comparing the two. I love this whiskey, nothing else like it that Ive tried. For less than $15, give it a go and find out for yourself.",It’S Not About Price!

Mellow Corn Whiskey 750ml,"I usually drink bourbon or scotch, but I've read about Mellow Corn online and wanted to try it.

Mellow Corn Whiskey 750ml,"I'm not going to say this is the greatest whiskey ever, but it's a remarkably solid drink for the price, and wrapped up in its garish label always catches people off guard with how smooth and drinkable it is for a bottom shelf 100 proof whiskey. Don't shout the secret too loud, now.",A Hidden Gem In Plain Sight
Mellow Corn Whiskey 750ml,,
Mellow Corn Whiskey 750ml,"Bottom line up front, this doesn't compare to Maker's Mark, Booker's, etc.. If you want to spend 2-8 times the cost then move along. For the price, and Bottled in Bond, this is a good bargain. I typically drink my Bourbon and Whiskey on the rocks. While this is good that way, I think it'll be good as a mixer. I'll be trying that in the near future.",Great For The Price!
Mellow Corn Whiskey 750ml,,
Mellow Corn Whiskey 750ml,"I bought this as a joke for my buddy who has very expensive tastes in whiskey, and was pleasantly surprised. Smooth, smooth, smooth. Goes down super easy for 100 proof. Nothing complex, simple corn sweetness, lacks the character of a bourbon, and it's not going to win awards for big flavor. But if you want something non-confrontational, maybe for a new whiskey drinker, you can't beat this for the price.",Lives Up To Its Name
Mellow Corn Whiskey 750ml,"The reason I say this is ""America's Irish whiskey"" because, like Irish whiskey (also Scotch) it is aged in USED oak barrels, the result is you get very little of the usual bourbon flavors and more of the corn whiskey itself. Smooth and mild with a rather light color, but at 100 proof packs a nice punch, I love sipping this as an alternative to bourbon. I am only disappointed that it recently went up in price some 25% and now is more expensive than Evan Williams 100 proof BiB bourbon.",America'S Irish Whiskey.
Mellow Corn Whiskey 750ml,"Bottled In Bond, 100 proof, 4 years of age in ex-bourbon casks, and disguised as garbage from the bar well. Hidden in plain sight, this might not be the most complex or intriguing whiskey on the shelf, but it's not only perfect for cocktails, but it's perfectly reasonable neat or with a bit of water as a daily drinker. No real off-putting notes, just simple, sweet corn whiskey with a reasonable, soft age to it. Almost fits somewhere between a bourbon and irish whiskey. Would stand up in a blind tasting to bottles 3x its price. Probably your local whiskey shelf's best kept secret. This will get rebranded and/or hit $20-25+/bottle in no time, so grab bottles while you can.",Grab This While It'S Still Cheap.
Mellow Corn Whiskey 750ml,"A $10.00 bottle of whiskey that drinks like a 30 dollar bottle. This is a unique whisky with a sugar frosted flakes vibe. It makes a great Old Fashioned and is a good sipper. It's not complex but it is very tasty, Bottled in bond at 50%. You can't get anywhere close to this for the money",Massive Bang For The Buck
Mellow Corn Whiskey 750ml,Absolutely delicious. I can only speak good things about it. If only Total Wine could keep it in stock.,A Must Have
Mellow Corn Whiskey 750ml,I enjoyed this on the rocks. Big kettle corn flavor and butter popcorn jelly beans. Probably a great mixer.,Heck Yeah
Mellow Corn Whiskey 750ml,"Bottom shelf staple that is unlike any other whiskey out there. Clean sweet 100 proof Bottled In Bond goodness. We used to make V8 Bloody Mary's with this, after running out of vodka, and it became a real go-to variation on a Bloody Mary: the salty V8 with the Mellow Corn sweetness, dash of Lea and Perrins, splash of Tabasco, stirred and granished with a fresh cut stalk of celery. Good as a rocks sipper, too. No big palate or huge finish, but at less than 15 dollars and at 100 proof... you cannot get a smoother whiskey. Put this on your ""must try"" list. Plus, dig that label! In a world full of retro packaging (take a look at a bottle of Craigellachie Single Malt sometime) this has had the same label since 1945...check out the copyright. Put this up there with the Evan Williams Kentucky Bourbon and Rittenhouse Rye Bottled in Bond as best bang for the buck, and hope Heaven Hill never messes with these classics.",Utter All Time Classic.
Mellow Corn Whiskey 750ml,"Seriously for $11 this is an amazing whiskey.... Like most I've past by this for years... But I love Heaven Hill products. Rittenhouse for old fashioneds, Elijah Craig for a daily, Barrel Proof for special occasions...as well as OF 1920 (I know it's not HH, but it's one of my favorites).... And now I have this bargain corn in the mix... It might become my new go to daily... At least for a while. Surprisingly good.",Color Me Impressed
Mellow Corn Whiskey 750ml,"I am the worst type of whiskey, bourbon and Scotch drinker I confuse the high price of the spirits with how good it is or how rare it is. I get confused with labels and secret special meanings that carry no weight , such as small batch, limited, Reserve, matured in the ocean, matured on a high mountain plane on the right facing side so that the sun doesn't hit it as often label , all that Bluster hoopla is what I fall victim to. And all I want is a good drink it doesn't break the bank. I've had several people tell me to try this out and I have not because it's $13. I have purchased Bourbon and Scotch as high as three, four, even five hundred dollars a bottle and it's simply not as good as this. That said, every Spirit offers its own unique story and can be enjoyed as such, however this corn whiskey is extremely good neat, with stones, or in a beverage. You will have no regrets in any manner that you choose to put this beverage into your body. This is now a staple corn whiskey on my bar cart. There is no long drawn-out finish to ponder on which is why it is so versatile, everything's up front and very clean.","Laughed At The Price, Now It'S A Staple"
Mellow Corn Whiskey 750ml,"I tried this on a recommendation from an employee and was very pleasantly surprised. I’ve been fortunate enough to try some of the best whiskies in the world, including other corn whiskies, and this more than holds its own. In fact, I’ve had corn whiskies at 4 times the price that were not as good. This is a whiskey that punches far above its weight class. This whiskey has a light corn and vanilla aroma, and tastes of popcorn, vanilla and, oddly enough, juicy fruit gum. It’s not sophisticated, but it’s straightforward. I’d not use an $80 bourbon to mix with Coke, but I’d use this all day with pleasure. When you factor in the cost this is an absolute steal.",Amazing Bargain
Mellow Corn Whiskey 750ml,Lots of corn flavor. You can taste the old HH cask it was in for 4 years in the finish. Definitely something I will be buying lots of in the future. It's a wonderful departure from the Whiskey I usually drink. It is going to be very interesting finding mixed drinks that work well with this flavor. I only wish Heaven Hill had a smoked version of this. It would be better than the vast majority of whiskey's on the market.,Despite The Price This Is A Top Shelf Corn Whiskey
Mellow Corn Whiskey 750ml,The makers must have a sense of humor to put out this aged corn whisky as Bottle in Bond -- like inviting the old-time revenooers in to watch your still. Doesn't remind me of modern moonshines; the aging really makes a difference. I'm thinking of putting some in a bourbon bottle to fool my friends. Surprisingly smooth and tasty.,"Not Moonshine, Much Better"
Mellow Corn Whiskey 750ml,"OK. This lacks a great finish... but it's still mighty fine sippin'. I'm sure you can mix it. I drank it straight. Wait. No. Had some egg nog with it once. But straight was way better. 4 years old (bottled-in-bond has to be), 100 proof (ditto) and aged in used whiskey barrels. Like pass it around with a few friends. At the last... bust out a good canadian fer a cocktail apiece. And say goodnight gracie. Cuz yeesh.",Ka-Pow!
Mellow Corn Whiskey 750ml,"100 proof bottled in bond corn whisky. The way it used to be! Excellent mash flavor, slightly sweet. But VERY easy going down at 100 proof. I have compaired it to some much more expensive whiskeys and this stuff deserves to be in your cabinet. Not a snobby aged bourbon or single malt, but it has it's place. A real good ""sippin' likker"", as grand pappy used to say.",A Mellow Yellow Sipper!
Mellow Corn Whiskey 750ml,"I was a bit hesitant to try MC due to the low price. But, I wanted to try a corn whiskey, and this one has gotten some good review on various whiskey forums. Well, they were not wrong. This juice is pretty darned good, and when you factor in the price, it's greatness. It's not aged bourbon, but I found it surprisingly smooth for it's age (probably two years or so). I got some amount of buttered popcorn in the taste, which I love. It can be a bit oily tasting, but not overly so. I drank this both on the rocks, and in a Diet Coke, and went through my first bottle pretty quickly. It's dangerously easy to drink. Believe me, this is way better than the overpriced faux moonshine that is all over the shelves. And, at half the price, it's a no-brainer.",A Great Value

Garrison Brothers HoneyDew Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,"The reason I give this bourbon such a low rating is not only because of my own opinion. I did a blind whiskey tasting with 10 other people, and we had 8 budget bourbons we tasted without knowing what they were. This was our “high end” entry for the tasting with other popular budget bourbons as a part of the line up (Bulleit, Buffalo Trace, etc.) This was unanimously everyone’s least favorite bourbon. My lowest ranked one of the bunch, personally. I was disappointed after doing the reveal of which was which and realizing that the most expensive entry of the bunch was the worst. This was nothing special in our opinion. Lacked complexity and a sweet flavor, which I was hoping for given the honey infusion. Not a terrible bourbon, but most definitely not worth $70. You’re better off buying a $30-40 bourbon. Low rating because it’s just not worth what you’re paying for.",Not Worth The Price
Garrison Brothers HoneyDew Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,This stuff is killer but you pay up for it. I’m a fan of I’m a fan of the Garrison Brothers line but they are proud of their stuff.

Garrison Brothers HoneyDew Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,I bought this bottle a couple weeks ago. It was pleasant. Bourbons are already naturally sweet. This one a touch more so due to the honey flavored nature of the bottle. Not as sweet as branch and barrels honey barrel aged which is good. The only thing I can fault it on is the price. Garrison brothers in general isn't worth the price. There's much better for the price point. At least this honeydew version isn't as dry and hot as it's classic counterpart.

Garrison Brothers HoneyDew Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,"Honestly, I grabbed this bottle to add to my collection to give to non-bourbon drinkers as stepping stone to other great bottles I own, enjoy, and wanted them to try. I changed my tune after tasting it as it did have more complexity than other flavored whiskeys I have tried. The balance of end noted honey flavor is a smooth transition and does not taste like a bag of sugar was dumped in like others I have tasted. I am used to higher proof bourbon so this one is a great summer sipper at 80 proof with friends new to the bourbon world.

Malloye Irish Whiskey 750ml,"I tried this Irish whiskey on the recommendation of a Total Wine sales associate who saw me eyeing another brand. I was told that I should stay away from the big name blends and give this single malt a try as it is “pure”. When I opened the bottle the only thing I found pure about it was the pure smell of alcohol. This whiskey isn’t terrible, but when you think Irish you think sweet and smooth. This is neither. It has an OK taste but the burn is ridiculous, both to the nose and the tongue it’s “pure” rubbing alcohol. I’m sure it would be OK as a mixer with ginger beer or with a bit of ice and water, but if you’re looking for a “single malt sipper” keep looking.",Not As Expected

Malloye Irish Whiskey 750ml,Excellent and reasonable.,"Excellent, Reasonable Irish"
Malloye Irish Whiskey 750ml,"My experience is limited: Irish Wolfhound (acceptable and very drinkable) and Kavanagh’s Single Malt (sweeter and more complex). With St. Patty’s day approaching I was tempted to try another relatively inexpensive Irish Whiskey.Its $20 cost belies its 92 rating. This 3 year old whiskey was smooth, not too sweet, and finished well. Very satisfying.",Very Satisfying
Malloye Irish Whiskey 750ml,Tried it out recently and loved it! Very smooth and easy to drink. Price can't be beat! Will keep this one in my bar!,Excellent On The Rocks!
Malloye Irish Whiskey 750ml,"First: this is NOT Irish pot still style -- if you are looking for any Redbreast character, then keep looking. See the Wikipedia entry on ""single pot still whiskey"" for more. What THIS is, is a bargain in a balanced, slightly smoky, 3 year old single malt, made in Ireland instead of Scotland. Only single malt Scotches and other single malts make a valid comparison. This single malt is made in Ireland (by who, where?), aged in oak barrels (ex-Bourbon?) for at least 3 years (in Ireland or the US?), imported in bulk (barrel or tank?), and bottled in Princeton, MN by United States Distilled Products Company under the name Malloye Spirit Company. I think USDP made a significant mistake labeling it ""Pure Old Pot Still"", because it does nothing but mislead: it has no established meaning, is extremely similar to ""Pure Pot Still"" which does have an established meaning, and bears no relation to that established meaning. I suspect Wine Spectator was fooled into comparing it with the wrong style, and some of the high score might merely reflect a preference for the single malt style.","NOT Irish Pot Still Style, But Bargain Single Malt"

SQRRL Peanut Butter Whiskey 750ml,"I conducted a taste test between Skrewball, PB&W, SQRRL and SkatterBrain drinking each neat at room temperature. I like them all and give each 5 stars although each tastes differently. This despite all being 70 proof. I give the nod to Skrewball as my favorite, possibly because this was the brand that turned me on to peanut butter whiskey in the first place, but I think it is the sweetest by as slight margin. SQRRL has the most syrupy ""texture"" (most viscous?) and the alcohol was most forward in PB&W despite all being rated identically. If they were wines, I would say that SkatterBrain was the ""driest"" (least sweet?). The one thing I really could not determine was which tasted ""most of peanuts"" and I think it is between PB&W and SkatterBrain, but this was indetermined.",Four Way Pandemic Bout - Peanut Butter Whiskeys

If you're in a pinch and want something cheap and trustworthy, this will do fine.",Bare-Bones Bourbon

Red Spot Irish Whiskey 750ml,Midleton and red spot are the best Irish whiskeys I’ve ever tasted!!!,Irish Whiskey
Red Spot Irish Whiskey 750ml,,
Red Spot Irish Whiskey 750ml,"The modern version of Red Spot was only reintroduced to the marketplace in Autumn 2018, having been on hiatus since the 1960’s. It’s bottled at 46% alcohol without chill-filtration. Tasting Notes. Appearance Medium Amber Aroma. The initial aroma was readily identifiable as being quite floral, which after a few minutes morphed into a beautiful caramel & floral confection. On The Tongue This whiskey delivers a gentle caress in the mouth, as you start to identify the flavors: Apple, a hint of pepper & sweet caramel & vanilla. Rich, full, and weighty on the palate. But the drama unfolds as the whiskey is exposed to air in the glass as both thermos & flavours morph before your nose & tongue. The change in aromas & flavours as you sip this fantastic whiskey is pure magic as the whiskey oxidises of the course of an unhurried tasting session. Finish A very clean finish, no oils left on the tongue. Not as long a finish as some of the competing Irish Pot Still whiskeys. Which Glass ? We started out initially with a wide, short crystal tumbler but the real oral explosions did not begin until we poured a little of the uisce beatha (Gaelic = water of life) into Riedel’s Single Malt glasses. The difference in taste was not subtle between the two glasses, the Riedel provided so much more fragrance, the micro flavours were more apparent. So too with the Riedel Single Malt whiskey glass; the aromas were more pronounced, the flavours that were once only subtle hints, now become more readily identifiable. Anyone splurging on premium & super-premium whiskeys would be well advised to invest in some of the Riedel glasses. Mitchell & Son Red Spot has a suggested retail price of about $130 in the USA. I have seen it as expensive as $300 and more often at $150. Total Wine sell it for $110 for a few weeks every year, clearly it sells out quickly.",An AMAZING Whiskey !
Red Spot Irish Whiskey 750ml,,
Red Spot Irish Whiskey 750ml,"If you like the taste of pot still Irish whiskey you won’t be disappointed. Very sweet and desert like, short bread with hints of banana and chocolate. If you like the green and yellow spot you will love the red spot.",Great Irish Selection
Red Spot Irish Whiskey 750ml,"Red Spot is really hard to find and the dram is very good. You get the sweetness from the sherry and Marsala. The initial nosing upon cracking open the bottle was freshly cut grass. Along with barely and some sweet wine notes. Finish is medium. Overall a very nice dram but Yellow and Green are really great and more readily available, just go for Yellow instead. 92/100.",Solid But Yellow Is More Available
Red Spot Irish Whiskey 750ml,"Hints of red vine, ripe apple skin, and light butter cookie. Lingering flavors forever.",Doesn'T Disasppoint!
Red Spot Irish Whiskey 750ml,Smooth. Good whiskey for the price. Very similar to yellow spot.,Very Decent Single Pot
Red Spot Irish Whiskey 750ml,"I was thrilled to find Red Spot available shortly after it's release in the US. If you are a fan of Green Spot and Yellow Spot, as I am, this is a tasty addition to the collection. The 3 barrels used to age Red Spot (Bourbon, Sherry, Marsala wine) result in a slightly peppery and balanced whiskey. Highly recommend.",Spot On!

Jim Beam Bourbon Whiskey PET 750ml,"What I really like about this young, standard offering from Jim Beam is that it is nice and dry for a bourbon. It seems to me that whiskey tends to taste sweeter with ice/water added, so this is a great one to drink on ice, since I tend to prefer drier whiskey. I like the relative dryness of this whiskey so much that I am considering switching from Evan Williams Black... or maybe I'll just keep both around. Evan is a better sip when drunk neat, straight from bottle to glass and sipped, but Jim is a better drink on ice, hands down. I love the strong 'corny' flavor that JB offers, with the lovely charcoal-ish, oaky char. A bit solventy on the tongue, but I feel that the rough edges give it character. To paraphrase the old saying; if it's too rough around the edges for you, it might be that your hands are too soft.",Good Stuff

Oola Waitsburg Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,"Poured neat into a Glencairn Glass. Color is on the lighter side, but has enough amber tones to be obviously a bourbon. Aroma starts with a light brown sugar sweetness, some cream corn notes and some black pepper spice. Ethanol is present on the nose throughout. Flavor largely follows suit with the nose, but transforms into what I can only describe as a sad graham cracker. Thankfully (depending on how you look at it) the finish is over almost immediately after you swallow. I would have given this whiskey an average score if it weren't for the cost. You can (and should) get better bourbons for half the price of this stuff.",Mild Bourbon With A Disappointing Finish
Oola Waitsburg Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,"Like many, my first bourbon was effectively ""embezzled"" from my parents modest cabinet (and may have been Old Crow, which could describe me now).

Connemara Single Malt Whiskey 750ml,"My brother gifted me this for Christmas and he picked the bottle purely on the description lol (cuz he’s not a whiskey guy). This is a beautiful product and I wish this came in cask strength instead of 80 proof. The nose is aggressively peated with an earthy/fire smoke intertwined with a sugar cookie sweetness. After it opens up, caramel, vanilla, floral, and faint sourness start to show up. The palate is more complex than the nose. It starts with a punch of smoke trailing with iodine which makes up most of the palate. Honey, pear, and an unknown green sweetness come through on the finish. Overall, this isn’t too complex. The NAS is apparent because there is a moderate amount of heat and I would guess this whiskey is around eight years old. This is one of the closest whiskies that resemble a Reposado mezcal with similar amounts of smoke, oak, and sweetness. This is priced ~$45 and can hold it’s own with comp. peated scotches. I feel this is a good alternative but not necessarily unique in terms of peated whiskey from the U.K. if they went in a blind head-to-head.

Connemara Single Malt Whiskey 750ml,"This is a very smooth whiskey. In spite of that, I will not be finishing the bottle I just opened because it tastes like a house fire, which I presume is from the peat. I have plenty of experience investigating tragic house fires, which is why I cannot recommend it. I can tell, however, that it is very well done- hence the four stars.

Connemara Single Malt Whiskey 750ml,"When life gives you lemons, you pick up a nice bottle of single malt and try to forget about the lemons. This Irish Whiskey Single Malt is very easy on the palate and yet has very decent lingering finish that is not overly peaty. It's just right. Kilbagan (sic) Distillery which produces some awesome Irish Whiskeys have done a great job with the Connemara line and the 12 year old is even better. Try Tori Mor Connemara (hard to find) if you like more peat but this is an awesome whiskey at a great price point.",The Peat Is Nice And Mellow.

Connemara Single Malt Whiskey 750ml,"What a great surprise! Except for good single malt scotch, this is my new favorite whiskey. Very smoky. Great for drinking straight with an ice cube or two.

Knob Creek Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,"Bright, bold & spicy - I did a head-to-head of 5 or 6 whiskeys I considered cheap enough to use as cocktail mixers, and this came out on top. The only thing I have that comes close for the money is Rittenhouse Rye... I give the KC9 the edge over the Rittenhouse, *and* if you buy the 1.75L it's cheaper per ounce. I particularly love KC9 in cocktails where the whiskey is the main attraction, like an Old Fashioned, Manhattan or Boulevardier (aka ""Negroni with whiskey instead of gin"") -- its bold spiciness and relatively high proof enhance those cocktails, vs. many whiskeys in my runoff (ex. Bulleit, Elijah Craig SB, Buffalo Trace, Evan Williams BiB) that mostly disappear into the background. An aside: of those I just listed, the EW BiB is the only one I consider worthy of sipping neat. That's an even better value I always keep in stock... I just don't use it for mixing, it's more of a good ""daily drinker"" at a substantially lower price point than this KC9. Back to the Knob Creek 9yr: I get caramel apple, floral & nutty notes, plus black pepper & cinnamon that carry through to a long finish. The bold, intense flavor holds up well to ice, or when I'm in the right mood I'll nurse it neat for some spicy drama. My ""price-blind"" score for this would be ~4 stars (mostly because I'm rarely in the mood to drink it neat instead of in a cocktail), but it easily jumps up to 5 stars when I factor in the price. Highly recommended... at some point I'll try the higher priced Knob Creek offerings, but IMO you just can't beat this @ the 1.75L price.",I Always Keep Knob Creek 9yr Small Batch On Hand!

Woodford Reserve Wheat Whiskey 750ml,"Woodford has an impressive and versatile catalogue and this was my first venture into wheat whiskey (that i can recall). The nose was soft and mostly floral which was different but not in a bad way. I poured one onto a single ice cube and in my first sip i caught mainly exactly what the nose showed. Floral, red fruit like perhaps apple and cherry. Subsequent sips brought nothing more. I did begin to pick up a bit of spice in the finish but none of the usual flavors you would normally find in traditional whiskeys or bourbons. It is sweet and fruit forward which is not my thing. I will finish the bottle and for the price point, it's doesn't hurt that it didn't appeal to my particular taste but i can't see myself pulling this off the shelves in the future. Funny enough, my gf liked it for the same reasons i did not. Perhaps that should be their marketing tool for this drink. A less punchy, soft whiskey for the ladies?? But i don't know cause i know some women that really enjoy strong, high proof stuff","Light, Balanced But Not My Thing"

Woodford Reserve Wheat Whiskey 750ml,"This is a wheated whiskey, not a wheated bourbon. 52% wheat, 20% malt (not barley or malted barley) 20% corn and 8% rye. It's a 4 - grain whiskey, which you don't see very often. Not heavy on the nose. At only 90.4 octane, I only get a faint apple/pear pie w/graham cracker crust. The taste is better, w/a mouth feel that has a good thickness. With a medium to medium/long finish. Vanilla Bean along with the fruit pie and baking spices come thru and a faint whisper of dark cocoa. This is definitely better than regular Maker's and Larceny.

Woodford Reserve Wheat Whiskey 750ml,"Creamy mouthfeel, fruity apples, pears, possibly strawberries as well. You get just a hint of eucalyptus from the rye. Overall, a very good wheat whiskey that suffers a bit from the lower proof. It can, at times, feel watery. I'm not going to run out and buy a second bottle anytime soon (just finished a bottle), but I think it's an above average wheat whiskey.

It says it right on the label ""Kentucky Straight Wheat Whiskey"" How do you call this a Bourbon? I think this is best neat, do not add water. It loses some flavor if you add water to it. candy cherry with a light touch of honey and vanilla. Round, soft and sweet withred vine licorice notes. Very soft and friendly whiskey.

Woodford Reserve Wheat Whiskey 750ml,"I have generally enjoyed all Woodford Reserve offerings, from their rare and delicious Malt, to their tried and true single barrel bourbon. I thought I'd never find their Wheat Bourbon, and generally enjoying wheaters (Weller and Breaker come to mind), as soon as I found this I bought it without question. Unfortunately, beyond a bright and alluring nose, the flavor profile fell decidedly flat. Where all varieties of Weller blossom into something magnificent, and every sip of Breaker Wheat seems to surpass the last, WR Wheat came up incredibly short on its follow-through. It's not bad, it's just far from magnificent, or truly worthwhile in my opinion. Seek out Breaker Wheat, you won't be disappointed.",Searched For So Long Too...

The second time I knew a little more of that to expect and it was very good. I know that when you go from Scotch to Bourbon the tastes are really different and I think that is what shocked me the first time I had a drink.

Jim Beam Double Oak Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,"A $15 bourbon, no more no less. That’s not necessarily bad but don’t expect more of this whiskey than it can deliver. Regular JB, which I like, is a better bet.",Enjoy It Mixed
Jim Beam Double Oak Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,"A welcome change to the ordinary. A great char-oakey flavor. A little spicy when consumed neat. Very smooth over ice, though it tends to lose a lot of it's profile when poured over ice, except for sweetness, that comes out when either ice or water is added. A fantastic sipping wiskey.",Great Flavor!
Jim Beam Double Oak Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,I'm a long time Gentleman Jack fan. I discovered Jim's twice barreled and was blown away by the high level of smoothness and the instant deep spicey caramel flavor. I'm hooked.,Extremely Smooth

Jim Beam Double Oak Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,"I keep my JBDO in the freezer. Along with my sipping glass. When I feel the mood, I take them both and pour the now syrupy JBDO, about an ounce, into my chilled sipping glass, which BTW is made of glass. Then I slowly sip the whiskey, holding it and rolling it around my mouth and let it slowly enter my throat on its own. Incredibly delicious. This works very well with Devil's Cut and JB Black and JB Vanilla as well. BTW, I add no ice.",Give This A Try. It Amazed Me!!
Jim Beam Double Oak Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,I have been enjoying bourbon for over 30 years. I have tried many brands. Jim Beam Double Oak rates very near the top of my favorites list. Very smooth with great flavor. Nice job Jim Beam.,JB Double Oak Is VERY Good Bourbon.

Jim Beam Double Oak Bourbon Whiskey 750ml,"Jim Beam Double Oak Bourbon is enjoyable to drink neat. At 86 proof it has a smooth taste with balance. It has less spicy and complex flavors than other bourbons in its price range, but enjoyable nonetheless. It's a noticeable step up from the black label. I might try several other bourbons before i buy it again, but i would still recommend it to a friend.",Enjoyable Bourbon

Writers Tears Double Oak 750ml,Writer's Tears Double Oak Irish Whiskey is a very drinkable newcomer to the Irish Whiskey scene. The honey color is beautiful and I could have easily enjoy half the 1/5th on first opening. Light and easy on the palate while saying I'm a memorable Irish Whiskey on the after finish. Welcome to my cellar!!,Newcomer Irish Whiskey Is Very Drinkable
Writers Tears Double Oak 750ml,"After trying the original incarnation of Writer’s Tears on vacation in Ireland, I wasn’t hugely impressed. I noticed the double oak a few nights ago and figured I’d test it out... and I’m glad I did. This is a whiskey that is not hiding beyond huge complexity, because it doesn’t need to. The extra aging in cognac barrels lends a certain deepness to this creation. It is buttery smooth, but doesn’t leave you wanting more. Notes of vanilla, spice, toffee, and buttery oak.",Surprisingly Delightful!

Balcones Lineage Single Malt Whiskey 750ml,The higher proof and Texas magic climate seem to make for some flavorful whiskeys. It's much easier to pick out flavors and aromas. I'm going to keep concentrating on Texas whiskeys to see if this continues as a general trend. I'm learning and so having something that is a little easier to pick out is really nice. I don't think that makes TX whiskeys for noobs. It's just that they seem to favor bigger more concentrated flavors and proof more for those flavors than they do for total profitability.,I Am Only Drinking TX Whiskey Now
Balcones Lineage Single Malt Whiskey 750ml,"Say you love Scotch and your best friend loves Bourbon. You’re heading to their house to hang and want to bring a bottle to share. THIS should be that bottle, Distilled like a scotch and aged like a bourbon, the flavors are fantastic. Keeps the best of both worlds. Great nose as well. A Texas single malt for the price of a mid shelf bourbon. It’s fantastic.",Great Flavors And Great Price.
Balcones Lineage Single Malt Whiskey 750ml,"Balcones is always a tough find, and I’m stoked that Total Wine doesn’t price gouge. This offering is a nice, sweet sipper.

Balcones Lineage Single Malt Whiskey 750ml,"Go search Youtube if you want detail reviews. For price and proof, this could be an entry for Balcones single malt, although it is not the same style of other Balcones. The strong, sweet fruity smell reminds me the smell of passion fruit, and some people think about honeydew or pineapple. The front taste is relative fruity sweetness, but that 47% ABV and wood tannin still generate some heat and bite in mid and end of the taste, especially if you are used to low ABV.",Tropical Sweet Fruit Bomb

I`m so glad I did what an amazing spirit, a nose that is subtle yet very intriguing. A nice medium to dark amber color and the flavor of the blend of malted barley is amazing.

Jim Beam Bourbon Whiskey 375ml,"FUNNY, I never really had this... WHEN I Ordered shots it was always Jameson, and when I ordered neat, it was always high brow stuff, and at parties, there was always something else to try. I admit rejecting Jim Beam as a bottom shelf budget bourbon, but a neat pour was handed to me, and I tried it... “Hey this is really nice, what is it.” ‘Jim Beam.’ “WOW... no kidding?” A few weeks went by. An open bar at an event offered JB or Jack, so I ordered Jim Beam and really enjoyed it with a nice plate of cheese and bread. I think this is going to become a staple in my home bar now... space is limited, so I will finish one of those existing bottles before I have room...

It has a sweet note that I enjoyed and at first, mistaked the weak finish as “smooth.” I am drinking one now NEAT; it has a typical “whisky nose burn”, taste sweet hints of vanilla for sure. Ends a bit more like other whiskies “on the rocks” but mind you that I am drinking it neat. I drink most of my whiskies with one or two cubes. It has a lot better finish drinking it NEAT.

Proper Twelve Irish Whiskey 375ml,"For 25-30 dollars you can find plenty of solid whiskies, including some good Irish whiskies, this isn't one of them. The most prominent note to the smell and taste is ethanol with a vague hint of synthetic vanilla. The best way I can describe its taste is a mix of 80% rotgut vodka and 20% whisky with a drop of vanilla extract. The taste has no complexity or evolution while the nose is almost exclusively ethanol, and for a 40% whisky its a surprisingly harsh ethanol smell. I was given a pour for free, and that's the only circumstance in which I would ever recommend drinking this. I would rather drink Power's, Jameson Caskmates, or even Mellow Corn; all of them cost less and taste better.",Subpar At Best

Proper Twelve Irish Whiskey 375ml,"So like most of you I read the reviews first and didnt know quite what to think. Were the bad reviews people who didnt like the whiskey? Or people that werent a fan of Connor? Since I am a whiskey collector with close to 85 bottles I thought I would buy this, add it to my collection and try it out for myself. Here is what I found...... I dont see the hype with the people rating this a 5* and I dont see they hype with the people bashing it and giving it a 1* quite honestly. The pop of the cork gives off a typical whiskey smell. Hints of vanilla are definitely apparent. Not quite tasting the honey others have referenced, but I do agree with a few other reviews that you could slightly compare the middle taste to Johnny Walker Black. That is a fair comparison. However, I will also agree with those that say that towards the end of the sip there is a strong alcohol taste that hits you that isnt like your normal whiskey taste. Now I wouldnt go deep like others and say it taste like battery acid or rubbing alcohol (That I believe is the Connor haters), but there is some truth to the ""odd"" taste. So where do I rank this? Certainly not a 5*, but definitely not the worst whiskey I have ever tasted (and I have tasted hundreds and hundreds). If you are a collector its worth having, if your looking for a cheap whiskey to have on your back burner its worth having (though there are others much better at this price) yet I also wouldnt throw the idea of having this bottle out as it is truly an ""AVERAGE"" whiskey. Not going to dazzle you, but for $21.00 what more do you expect? I love Connor, but can only say I ""like"" his whiskey. For that reason I give this whiskey a sincere 3* all day long. Too good to rate a 2 star yet nowhere near good enough to rate a 4 star. So there you have it folks. Another honest review from BOSTON SHANE",Here Is The Honest Truth About Proper Twelve

Irish whiskey is usually a safe bet, they're generally all drinkable. If not neat, fine as a mixer. It's the reason there's usually not a need for reviews. There just aren't any bad ones. Well that ends with Proper Twelve. My one star rating might seem harsh, as I've had plenty of American whisky that is far worse, but as far as Irish? There is none below this at any price. It burns like the most inexpensive bottom-shelf swill available and has a distinct aftertaste of isopropyl alcohol---rubbing alcohol.

I got a lot of honey upon my first few sips, but there was something bitter undercutting it. It was like the taste of honey, but without the sweetness. I didn't really taste a whole lot of vanilla or oak.

However, there are better options at similar price points. Both Powers Gold Label (at 43% and NCF) and even Tullamore Dew's own XO (also 43%) have a fuller and rounder flavor, and a smoother finish. Makes a good Irish Coffee though.",Decent Introduction To Irish Whiskey

Tullamore Dew Irish Whiskey 375ml,"This was the first Irish whiskey I tried past the good ole' Jameson. First tried it a local Irish pub and instantly fell in love. Pretty smooth, hits all the right tasting notes. Will say it lacks some complexity of others I have tried since then, like redbreast 12 yr, green spot etc. But as a nightly drink with dinner it is a great sipper. At a good inexpensive price. Often find it on sale as well. Will most likely be the first bottle I get as a sub $30 for the second time. Especially as I continue to explore more mid range price bottles.","Great Value, At An Inexpensive Price."

Tullamore Dew Irish Whiskey 375ml,"One of the best all-around whiskies, it has something for all experience levels. If you're new to whiskey, this is a classic place to start since it has no alcohol legs, has tasting notes anyone can find and finishes well. It's a great whiskey to learn on and everyone I've shared it with can find the flavor notes. On the nose, it's rich but delicate: sweet with bread dough that opens to light caramel, very open and with floral notes. No alcohol smell. On the palate, fine: a touch of bread dough opens to fresh pear (both flesh and skin), floral notes, a little oak, and finishes with that light caramel. ZERO burn. The florals make it a super summer whiskey, but the pear and caramel notes make it a fine autumnal libation, too. It's great in coffee (esp your sweeter tea-like Kenyan and Ethiopian varietals), sips very well, pairs well with many cheeses and even works when enjoyed with a bowl of fresh fruit.",Like All Good Things Its What'S INSIDE That Counts

Tullamore Dew Irish Whiskey 375ml,"I have been only drinking Tullamore D.E.W. Original only for a few months, However, I must say, this is just about as close as I can get to my fantasy of what Irish whiskey needs to be, honestly representing a national Irish drink. The distillation process makes it, with a little perfect water, an extremely smooth-tasting, pleasing pastime. It is hard to hold off until the mid-afternoon to enjoy the pleasantry of Tullamore. This will be my constant Irish Companion, as I make continue plans to visit the Tullamore Distillery in 2021. I look forward to purchasing other bottled varieties during this coming year and intend to bestow the best upon my family who share the desire to taste a bit, of what Ireland has to offer!",A Perfect Compliment To Eire And The Irish!
Tullamore Dew Irish Whiskey 375ml,Awesome Irish whiskey. Try it and you will like it.,Great Whiskey
Tullamore Dew Irish Whiskey 375ml,"The nose is suprisingly nice for the cost. The fruit hits you immediately and it's more pleasent then a lot in this price point. the green apple and light oak is present on the nosing, then with the taste the vanilla and apple create an almost caramel apple flavor. the finish is short, it has a bitter oak that somewhat ends the caramel apple fun, but after the bitterness fades you're left with an almost peppermint on the sides of your tongue. For the dollar this is a very pleasant easy sipper. It's definitely not as exciting as some more expensive options, it doesn't take you on a journey, and there are no surprises, but for the dollar it's worth grabbing a bottle. My biggest gripe and the reason for holding out on that fifth star would be the bitterness in the finish. If they could tame that this would be a definite 5 star rating.",Good Price Point
Tullamore Dew Irish Whiskey 375ml,"Great product, always some available. Getting more next time.",Love The Tullamore Dew.
Tullamore Dew Irish Whiskey 375ml,Been mostly a bourbon/rye drinker for 30+ years but been trying different watering holes lately and I have to say I was quite surprised by this. The nose is delicate and floral. The intro is spicy with heat following after that tapers down as quick as it comes to leave a long sweet honey/vanilla sensation and finishes sort of dry with wood notes.

Tullamore Dew Irish Whiskey 375ml,"I am a die-hard Jameson Whiskey fan, but to get it in a 1.75L bottle at a reasonable price I have to travel to NH to save on the taxes and catch a sale twice a year. The local BBQ place I was eating at ran out of Jameson so they offered me a Tullamore, I said sure, its Irish! I was immediately impressed by how smooth it was and tasty! I understand what people mean by the lack of complexity it has compared to Jameson though and I get it. But for the $35 price tag it helps me spread out my $40-$47 Jameson bottles and am quite satisfied as a (1) daily drinker. I only wish when I went to Ireland last spring we had stopped at the distillery when we drove by on the highway.","They Put The ""Oooo"" Back In ""Smooth""!"
Tullamore Dew Irish Whiskey 375ml,It would be hard to find someone who does not enjoy this. Extremely smooth and sweeter than most Irish whiskeys.

Tullamore Dew Irish Whiskey 375ml,"I bought a 1.75L of TD recently due to its being very cost-effective, and because I recalled Tullamore as being a very admirable budget Irish whiskey. While it's by no means bad, I must say that it is much less interesting than I remember. I don't know if it's Tullamore itself or, likely, my palate becoming more acquainted with good whiskeys carrying greater complexity. Either way, I have a hard time seriously recommending Tullamore Dew for anything more than a good mixing cocktail Irish Whiskey. For a few dollars more, I find Powers gold label to be much more interesting and flavorful... For a few dollars more than that, Teeling's small batch blows them both out of the water, in my humble opinion. I personally don't see myself reaching for my Tullamore Dew nearly as much as I was hoping I would at the price point, when for several dollars a bottle more I can have a much richer, more enjoyable experience elsewhere in Irish whiskey.",Not As Good As I Remember

Pendleton 1910 Rye Whiskey 750ml,"This is the best Canadian whiskey I've had--but that's not saying much, as I find them to range from sweet to sickly sweet. It has the smoothness of a 100% rye. Also, unusually, you can really taste charred barrel; not smokiness, not caramel (which is also there) but actually char, which I'm undecided about. But true to Canadian form, it's just overwhelmingly sweet to my taste, cloying really. Drink this side by side with another high mashbill rye, or a single malt, and the sweetness is obvious. 12 yr 100% rye, you'd think, ""What's not to like?"" Certainly not bad, and for the price quite good. Alas, it's not a sipper for me; I use it for Manhattans, and when it's gone I'll move on. Shame, I'm sure our neighbors up north know how to make excellent whiskey, but I've yet to find it.",Good But Sweet

Jack Daniels Sinatra Select Tennessee Whiskey 1l,"I have been an avid Jack Daniels drinker for most of my adult life and the Jack Daniels Sinatra is one of the finest I have had the pleasure of drinking. This is definitely a sipping whiskey and is very easy on the palette. However, if you like a more mellow drink 1 ice cube should do the trick as you definitely would not want to dilute the effervescence of this full bodied whiskey.",Jack Daniels Sinatra - Worth The Price!
Jack Daniels Sinatra Select Tennessee Whiskey 1l,"Old No.7 is my whiskey of choice. I bought this bottle because of the significance Sinatra had on Jack Daniel’s, and because I’ve heard really good things about it. It’s extremely smooth, yet still lets you know you’re drinking Jack Daniel’s. To me, it’s the same as Old No.7, yet more pronounced on the pallet and nose and a much better finish. Gentleman Jack can’t compare. I’d pay the $160 again.",Surprisingly Smooth
Jack Daniels Sinatra Select Tennessee Whiskey 1l,"Okay I’m a big Frank Sinatra fan. I’ll probably buy this again despite the high price. Just the thought for me that this may resemble the Jack Daniels Frank drank in the 1950s was reason enough for me to try this. I really like it. It’s smooth. I think it tastes like regular JD turned up a bit with noticeably more oakiness. I love this. I’m not saying there isn’t something out there that tastes as good for less, but hey the bottle doesn’t say Sinatra. So for Sinatra fans and JD fans this is worth a try. Personally I think the Sinatra should be the Jack Daniels standard.",Smooth Like Sinatra
Jack Daniels Sinatra Select Tennessee Whiskey 1l,Got this for Christmas 2 years ago and was wowed by how smooth it is. I’ve been a Jack Daniels drinker for over 40 years and have been doing Gentleman Jack for about 15 years. This is the 3rd Sinatra I’ve bought for my self. Total Wine price is the best as I can pick up with no shipping.,Sinatra Jack Daniels ROCKS!
Jack Daniels Sinatra Select Tennessee Whiskey 1l,"I suppose you could consider me a connoisseur of sorts regarding whiskey. I have purchased and experienced all kinds of different fantastic drinks. Sinatra Jack, which is aged in Sinatra's own barrels that are grooved to increase the exposure surface area, is very easy to drink. I have found a few bottles here and there which were consumed rather quickly and in my opinion, this is the very best. ** I have not tried Sinatra Century yet.",Easily America'S Best Whiskey

Jack Daniels Sinatra Select Tennessee Whiskey 1l,"My first legal drink was Jack - when it was 90 proof. The 80 proof does not have the character.

Jack Daniels Sinatra Select Tennessee Whiskey 1l,"i won a bottle of this from a bet with my brother, I had two of these sitting on my shelf already.

I tend to enjoy ryes with a high rye content and ones made in an old-fashioned way.

Bulleitt, James Pepper 1776, and Templeton were early rye favorites. Angel's Envy Rye is my favorite. They are all sourced from MGP. Darby's Reserve Rye Whiskey is entirely another animal. TotalWine in Seattle (Northgate# features Darby's with a recommendation from the store manager on a printed placard on the shelf. Jeff happened to be nearby and answered my questions about Darby's. It has a different process #I think he said a vacuum still) and is ""aged for months"". I didn't know whether to be intrigued or disgusted by that. I bought a 750mL bottle and find it very interesting in the glass. The aroma is quite unusual with some leather notes and a type of sweet candy like smell. That was odd. But the taste is smooth and really pretty nice. It is a nice contrast to Rittenhouse Rye, my current budget favorite. It is good to have options and some variety. I think the point for me is that the taste of a rye whiskey shouldn't be contained within MGP or similar constraints. I will buy this again sometime in the future. But right now there are many rye whiskies to try.",Very Smooth Pleasant Taste With An Odd Nose
Darby'S Reserve Rye Whiskey 750ml,I thought I would try this rye as it was from South Carolina and wasn't an expensive experiment. Wasn't anything like aged ryes that I enjoy. Have it at my bar but can't even offer it to guests with good conscience.,Don'T Bother
Darby'S Reserve Rye Whiskey 750ml,"This stuff is pretty decent. In the $21 range, I usually go for Wild Turkey 101. About to try Old Grand Dad 114 (next visit). I like high alcohol content bourbon/rye - leaning on the rye side. A lot of people (hence bourbon chef) knock this...but it is what it is. Good stuff for $21. For a few more, I may go to Dickel Rye. A couple more even, Bulleit Rye (fantastic for the price). Keep going up in price, and the options continue...BUT for $21...this stuff's tasty.",Bang For The Buck
Darby'S Reserve Rye Whiskey 750ml,"The only reason why this got 1 star from me was because there was nothing smaller to choose from. I could not even finish one glass before I gave up on this one. I should have known something was wrong when the nose reminded me of some artificially flavored kid's drink. The actual flavor that followed was much worse. There are much better bottle out there in this price range. Spend a couple of bucks more and get a bottle of Bulleit Rye, you will be glad you did.",Not Good Enough To Be Called Whiskey
Darby'S Reserve Rye Whiskey 750ml,I tried this rye on a whim and am not impressed. There is definitely something off on the flavor. I think the other review got it just about right: it tastes the way a campfire smells after you douse it with water... Will not be purchasing again and I would not recommend wasting your money..,Not Worth It
Darby'S Reserve Rye Whiskey 750ml,"It's a processed Rye and not aged but that being said, it's not bad. It does have some kind of artificial aftertaste. I liken it to the difference between Coke and Diet Coke. Almost but not quite. It should be cheaper....",It'S Not Bad...
Darby'S Reserve Rye Whiskey 750ml,I have been drinking rye for a couple years now. I have tried several. This one was not among my favorites. Another reviewer mentioned aftertaste. I have to agree.

Jefferson'S Straight Rye Whiskey Cognac Finish 750ml,"Pouring out the first glass of this Jefferson leaves me with disappointment. My experience with finished ryes are solely and pleasantly with Angel's Envy; setting the bar for exotic and wild flavors. It is by no means distasteful, and I look forward to drinking it again, however, it lacks the flavors and nuances expected from cognac casks, especially for the price. It is on par with Woodinville rye or a proofed down Wilderness Trail single barrel rye. You'll be pleasantly greeted with a forward honey sweetness, rich cinnamon spice, mild tannins, and warm after taste. I recommend trying Jefferson's rye, but maybe at a bar or a friend's house, or else you'll be left with a $50 whiskey at a $75 price.",A Good Rye (But Not A Finished One)

I’ve had many bourbon’s at the same and lesser price with more complexity, taste and alcohol. I think this is a case of overpriced popularity. It’s sweet and floral on the nose. The same goes for the palate. The finish seems to be a bit woody with a moderate amount of heat. It holds momentarily but is not extremely long. If I could sum this one up, I’d say it is a nice average bourbon, easy to drink and doesn’t have too much going on. But it’s priced in a range of higher value bourbons, in my opinion. And the proof is on the low side so it doesn’t even have that going for it. It’s decent, but too hyped up giving it too high of a price.",Average Bourbon With Above Average Hype

Angel'S Envy Bourbon 750ml,"This is the second bottle I've had, and it confirmed to me that this is highly overrated. The first bottle (1 year ago) was overly sweet and to my taste: harsh. This bottle is less sweet, but the nose on it smells like nail polish remover, the mouth feel is light but sweetish with good spicey notes, but the tail is ... well, harsh. As I get older, I appreciate rich and smooth. I much prefer Heavens Door and even moreso: Jefferson's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Select over this. Not worth the wait to find a bottle of this. Get the Total Wine Jefferson's Barrel Select. Same price/ much better! 98... pshhhhhhhh!?",Not All That....
Angel'S Envy Bourbon 750ml,"If you like bourbon this is good not the best but enjoyable has the sweetness that a bourbon should have, for me I had on the rocks it is a complex bourbon unlike the lower end bourbons. It is hard to find when you do get two bottles you will not regret.",Amazing
Angel'S Envy Bourbon 750ml,"I'll be honest and start by warning this will be a fairly lengthy and substantial review... I've been a hardcore Bourbon/American Whiskey/Rye ""guy"" for about 5 years. I'm 37 years old. I originally only got into this realm of spirits to learn how to make myself the best OLD FASHIONED on planet earth. I've almost succeeded. I barrel-age a mixture of several bourbons and Ryes for several months and up to 1.5 years to achieve an Old Fashioned none of my friends can resist, yes even my non Bourbon drinker friends lol. Mine is second only to Cucina (by Wolfgang Puck) at Crystals in Las Vegas... No shame knowing mine will always be second as long as that place continues doing whatever they're doing. And they do it best! I've had four years of experimenting and barrel aging many of the top Bourbons and American Whiskeys and Ryes. So I've tasted most of the favs and many of the unsung or even hard to find rarities. I brag constantly on the Bourbon community. I always tell people we're not like the ""snob wine crowd"", lol (I love wine too btw). Generally speaking, we keep it real and price doesn't usually matter in terms of dictating what we like or don't. That's what I like about whiskey drinkers. We don't care if it's $30 or $130. It almost never seems to affect what our taste buds say... That being said, for compete transparency I feel I should disclose some of my top personal choices so when reading this you understand exactly where I'm coming from... ALL my choices are based on standalone flavor (neat or with a small, clean ice cube) but regardless of price or hype/public opinion. (MY FAVS) Bourbon for sipping... • Heaven's Door Bourbon (probably my favorite overall) • Wild Turkey Master's Keep 17 • Four Roses Single Barrel • Bowman Brothers Virginia Small Batch • Blanton's Single Barrel • Bib & Tucker • Wild Turkey Rare Breed (Yes, 116.8 proof! HAHAHA) (MY FAVS) Rye Whiskey for sipping... • High West Rendezvous Rye (my fav) • Whistle Pig Straight Rye 10 Year (very unique and distinct!) • Bulleit Rye • Redemption Rye In fairness, all the above choices obviously indicate I tend to like distinct Bourbons packed with LOTS of flavor with complexity and a good amount of heat with a nicely moderate to long finish. Any Bourbon drinker who tastes AE knows immediately these are NOT characteristics of this AE Bourbon. So now it comes down to personal choice... For me personality, I was DEFINITELY disappointed in AE, first at the lack of complexity and distantly second considering the price. I only bring up the price factor to make the obvious point to those who actually do care about price point when comparing Bourbon. Some of my favs are the same price, some are 1/2 or 2/3 the price then others are 3 or 4 times the price of AE. Just a note for those who prioritize price... I personally don't believe anything product is overpriced because if it truly were NOBODY /so few would buy it and they'd be out of business. AE appears to be doing just fine. Ok, now I must admit I can't help but notice AE is the ONLY Bourbon on this site with an amazing and untouchable ""enthusiast score"" of ""98"" which is GREAT for the brand yet unfathomable to me. I then must realize the persons responsible for this score are NOTHING like me when it comes to personal preference and taste. That's just the way it is... But I must also acknowledge an obvious ""wine snob"" hype about this particular Bourbon... First of all, it's NOT hard to find. Every TW I've visited has tons of bottles on the shelf, they just don't tell you online. Instead they say ""Limited Quantities"" and ""not available for purchase online"", which sucks. But just walk in the store and there it is. So I'd argue there is a bit of misconception to how NOT rare AE really is. At least in the Southwest U.S. Region across multiple states. I travel often and see it most places I visit... On the other hand, Blanton's Single Barrel not so much. It's truly rare, just about anywhere across multiple CONTINENTS! So getting back to the ""wine snob"" hype I see everywhere concerning this Bourbon, I'm telling you just go and look at ANY review on this site that's NOT positive and ""ALL IN"" about this particular Bourbon and just look at how many people actually take the time to click the ""NO"" (NOT HELPFUL REVIEW BUTTON) on SOME people who are just being plain HONEST about their experience with this product. Some of these reviewers had the EXACT experience as I did regarding expectations and ""98"" enthusiast rating!!! C'mon gimme a break... If it's available, I seriously suggest ""Heaven's Door"" which is also fairly rare across the country right now. Or Four Roses Single Barrel at that price. Forget Single Barrel, I'd even suggest regular old Four Roses Bourbon for $22. Less than half the price! But even more for the flavor profile. They are more similar than not... Fairly sweet and very nondescript. Eagle Rare is also fairly similar as well for twice the price at $50, but tastes better, smoother and cleaner than AE, in my opinion. Also keep in mind I've also logged at least a thousand hours sampling these and many other ""popular favs"" that are great when mixed together in my old fashioned barrel. So the flavor profile of each bottle is KEY for me... Here are just a few of the ones I've used in my OF barrel but maybe not quite as delicious for the single, sole purpose of ""sipping"" in MY opinion: •Eagle Rare, Bulleit 10 Year, Four Roses Small Batch, Maker's 46, Clyde May's, Jefferson's Reserve, Old Forrester, Woodford Reserve Double Oaked, Redemption Tyler's Mistake... Now I highly recommend ALL of these, but they miss my personal top choice list ""exclusively for sipping"". In my personal opinion AE falls much shorter than ANY of these in my book regardless of price, but for those of you who must factor in price - I'd imagine it's even worse for the price-conscious, considering the $50 tag. So, where do I see this Bourbon fitting in? I can see this bottle living on a high shelf in the wet bar of someone's house waiting for some unassuming non Bourbon drinker who never drinks Bourbon or Whiskey but may be interested in sampling. Someone who is new to Bourbon may like it... And to be clear I don't honestly believe everyone who likes AE is full of hype, but I certainly can't ignore the hype... But for those of you who are seasoned Bourbonites, do whatever you want, get it or don't. I'm not here to tell you what to do, but consider yourself forewarned on the massive hype on this bottle. You may like this, despite the risk being very high... But if you asked me, I'd say get ANYTHING else... Save this $50 and put it toward your dream Bourbon bottle. That's my suggestion. Thanks for reading!","Overrated For Sure, But May Have It'S Place."
Angel'S Envy Bourbon 750ml,"Like many others, I was clued into this based on good reviews and recommendations from friends, so when I finally saw it in stock, I got myself a bottle. I get what everyone is talking about! If I didn't know better, I'd think I was drinking 3-4 different bourbons here. One sip is sweet and smooth with no burn, another is woody with a mild burn, another is spicy/peppery with a strong burn. One sip I get a floral finish, another a cinnamon finish, and so on. So many different things going on within one glass of this bourbon! That said, I prefer smooth and sweet with very little burn, and too many sips of this had too much burn for me to give it 5 stars. It's clearly different from any of the 15 or so Bourbons I've tried thus far, so I'll keep it around, I'll enjoy it from time to time, I'll share it with others, and I'll definitely recommend it.","A Lot Going On, But Not Quite My Style"
Angel'S Envy Bourbon 750ml,"This or Blantons under $100...if you can find it. There's a reason you can't find this stuff anywhere....when you do, buy it! I drink it too fast and then have to search (and usually overpay) for more.",C'Mon...Best Under $100!
Angel'S Envy Bourbon 750ml,"I was a little skeptical when I first came across this brand. Cool looking bottle and very reasonable price, but was told that it rated higher than bottles 2-3x the price.

Angel'S Envy Bourbon 750ml,"I see a few people leaving 1 and 2 star reviews. They are obviously not true bourbon enthusiasts. I have sampled bourbons from all over the world. Finally someone has perfected the art. Angels Envy is by far the smoothest bourbon on the planet today. Don’t get me wrong, I like a deep bourbon whisky just as much as the next guy, but the hot, burpy, heartburn bourbons have been getting on my last nerve.

Angel'S Envy Bourbon 750ml,"After all the hype and this bourbon never being in stock, I finally had a chance to get a bottle and wow what a disappointment. For me the aroma on the nose lacked appeal. It did hit the palate smooth with a hint of sweetness, but it dissipated so fast and just felt watered down to me. I wouldn’t buy it again, but I can see why an entry level bourbon drinker might like it. In my opinion at $50 a bottle it is overpriced, I can think of several other bourbons at lower price points I would rather drink.",Just Average......

Angel'S Envy Bourbon 750ml,"But IMO it's pretty close in terms of taste. I understand everyone has different tastes so one may not always agree that a particular Bourbon is better than another. I was fortunate enough to get a bottle of the Pappy 15 Year 2 years ago and still have a few shots left. I didn't want to drink in one setting so I was on a mission to find something similar at a much lower price. I tried many of the highly rated bourbons that are mentioned in this thread but AE was truly the only one I found that compares.

The nose is immediately sweet. I am not sure if the appiocot is the key note or it is the combination of the 3 finished barrels. l think the rum barrel is having a major effect. I get a coconut note. The proof is muted. On the palet, wow this thing coates the whole mouth. Getting pepper on the front an mid palet. Tons of ripe fruit just after the pepper and that fruit continues into the finish and the finish is long. I identify the rum in the finish and that coconut is also in the finsh. So it is desert.

I’m not usually a fan of rum casks but the apricot brandy leads the charge as the palate opens with sweet, floral, fruity notes that make Seagrass a happy Summer dram. Right when you think the sweetness is going to go too far, it gets balanced by distinctly rye spice with a long finish and solid mouthfeel. The high ABV delivers massive flavor without overpowering the palate. No traces of soap or dill in this rye, either.

Barrell Seagrass Rye Whiskey 750ml,I'm a big rye fan but this is nothing likeI've e had before- and that's not a bad thing. A lot more fruit from the apricot brandy barrel aging and some nice subtle flavor from the rum barrels. Dangerously smooth at 119 proof.,Totally Unique Rye.
Barrell Seagrass Rye Whiskey 750ml,When people discuss tasting notes on whiskey I think that 90% of them are making it up. This is the first whiskey that I could actually identify different flavors. I wasn’t sure I’d like it because rum barrels and apricot brandy barrels would lead you to believe it is going to be sickeningly sweet but it is not. It is a little hot because it’s a 120 proof rye so it’s definitely a sipper.,Really Good

Redbreast Small Batch Cask Strength Irish Whiskey 750ml,"You can tell it's in the Redbreast family, however, on the palate, it tastes a bit hot and young. I do enjoy the dark fruits but it feels like a $60 to $70 bottle rather than the $120 price",Hot And Young
Redbreast Small Batch Cask Strength Irish Whiskey 750ml,"Didn't think this was a Redbreast. 100 bucks way too much for a 9 year old irish. It just wasn't there for me. If you got a hundred, get 15 year or 12 year cask.",Not Great

Hudson Do The Rye Thing Straight Rye Whiskey 375ml,,
Hudson Do The Rye Thing Straight Rye Whiskey 375ml,This is one of my favorite Ryes. I have had the bourbon one but the Rye overall is the best I have head and will be buying many more of what Husdon has to offer.,Great Rye
Hudson Do The Rye Thing Straight Rye Whiskey 375ml,"Just has an off flavor. Almosted peated, but... Not quite. I love rye and this is very meh.",Not Good
Hudson Do The Rye Thing Straight Rye Whiskey 375ml,"Rye is my preferred American whiskey, which is why I was surprised several years ago to find that the best rye I'd ever tasted was actually made in the Netherlands by the Zuidam folks. A close second was Old Potrero, by the Anchor beer people (70+ bucks, yikes!). This Do The Rye Thing is now my favorite rye, because of its flavor, the fact that I can lay my hands on it, and its reasonable price (for the quality). If you like rye whiskeys like Bulleit, Woodford, Old Forester, etc. (personally I do), those basically taste like dry, spicy bourbons compared to this (I like bourbon too). This has a significantly different flavor profile from more common rye whiskeys, I just love it. You can really taste the rye, it's kind of like the smell of rye crisps or bread, or freshly ground grains. There's nothing wrong with the more widely available ryes out there, but I'm tempted to say that THIS is what real rye tastes like. And I can confirm that it makes a splendid Manhattan. If you like this, by the way, you'll love ryes by Zuidam, Leopold Bros, and Old Potrero (all harder to find where I am, and/or pricier).",My New Favorite Rye
Hudson Do The Rye Thing Straight Rye Whiskey 375ml,"just picked this up yesterday, tasted of home depot and floor stripper. no discernable whiskey flavors, just a long lasting feeling of regret, and a minor case of ptsd.",Grrrosss. Not For Me
Barrell American Vatted Malt Whiskey 750ml,"Deep notes of citrus and vanilla. Cask strength means... you feel it on the palate and all the way down. Bought this on a lark, really enjoy the flavors here.",Wow
